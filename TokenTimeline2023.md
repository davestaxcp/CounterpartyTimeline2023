Date: **Jan 2, 2014** 

Timeline Asset/Project: **XCP**

Significance: [XCP](https://xchain.io/asset/XCP) is technically Asset ID #1 on Counterparty and was created through a [proof-of-burn](https://counterparty.io/news/why-proof-of-burn/) by burning a certain amount Bitcoin to bring XCP into existence. The Primary Developers of Counterparty during its origin were: Adam Krellenstein, Robby Dermody, and Ouziel Slama. The genesis [Bitcointalk Forum post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=395761.0) titled: "Counterparty - Pioneering Peer-to-Peer Finance - Official Thread" is one of the earliest publications relating to the Counterparty Platform.

Date: **Jan 13, 2014** 

Timeline Asset/Project: **TEST**

Significance: This is the first user tokenized asset to be minted on Counterparty. It had no text, image, audio or any data associated with it. Years later when this historical token was re-found, the creator of the asset decided [to add some key information](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmf8AEoLbUoJBA7z2xh8bbV7SiUGYZufHvh9msDQecEmNq) and some community art to represent it. It was created by the Bitcointalk Forum user by the name of 'jimhsu' when [he was testing](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=395761.msg4511768#msg4511768) the Counterparty Protocol. [TEST](https://xchain.io/asset/TEST) was also used for testing the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange. At the time Etherscan founder, Matt Tan was also one of the parties involved in testing Counterparty functionality. TEST is considered the first 'Fungible' user asset created historically on the Counterparty protocol. It was even created before the protocol required 0.5 XCP burned to create a named asset.

Timeline Asset/Project: **LEET**

Significance: The first divisible asset that was issued by a user was [LEET](https://xchain.io/asset/LEET). It simply was the first asset that could be broken down into smaller units. Possibly considered the first truly fungible asset that did not have "whole units". The total supply was a meme number (1337.00000000 Units).

Timeline Asset/Project: **LTBCOIN**

Significance: Let's Talk Bitcoin was a bitcoin centered [podcast and website](https://web.archive.org/web/20230131224146/https://letstalkbitcoin.com/) created in April of 2013. Adam B. Levine, Andreas Antonopoulos, and Stephanie Murphy are the most well-known contributors at Let’s Talk Bitcoin, but the network was comprised of a multitude of freelance (autonomous) editors, contributors, and sponsors, plus their rapidly growing audience. The idea behind LTBcoin was to generate a finite number of coins and then distribute those coins over a five year period based on a pre-defined distribution protocol. In this manner, contributors, members of the audience, and every other stakeholder can earn LTBcoins while maintaining a vested interest in the overall health of the network. LTBcoins were earned by producing or consuming content on the website and used as currency to buy items such as merchandise and advertising on podcasts. [LTBCOIN](https://xchain.io/asset/LTBCOIN) was also listed on major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges at the time, including Bittrex and Poloniex. It may be considered one of the first "altcoins" made on the Counterparty Platform.

Timeline Asset/Project: **MICE**

Significance: In April 2014, three tokens with the name [MICE](https://www.xcp.dev/asset/MICE) and the description: “<:3_)~ squeak!” made their way into the Counterparty database. They’ve been hiding ever since, not to be seen even on the xchain Counterparty block explorer, but they are visible in the Counterparty Database. This asset is one of the most "hidden" historical tokens.

Significance: This asset, [BOMB](https://xchain.io/asset/BOMB), simply has the description 'Adeally Equity Shares' which appears to be the asset used for equity in a company named [Adeally](http://adeally.com/). This company looks like it sought to be a shopping website that included entertainment, products and possibly other products using the Counterparty protocol for company share ownership.

Date: **May 28, 2014**

Timeline Asset/Project: **SWARM**

Significance: [SWARM](https://xchain.io/asset/SWARM) was a token representing the Swarm Corporation which funded "coin-powered accelerators to incubate and coach young businesses". It was the first project on Counterparty to try to facilitate a 'crowdfunding' process like Kickstarter, but backed on Counterparty assets. The Swarm [official website](https://swarm.com/) stated at launch: "accepted companies will raise more money faster and with reduced costs. Swarm companies will offer investors real equity in turn for investment dollars instead of being limited to gifts or early access to products."

Date: **Jun 4, 2014**

Time Asset/Project: **TATIANACOIN**

Significance: Tatiana Moroz, a graduate of Berklee College of Music, has been a vocal advocate in the Bitcoin community since 2012. She was a part of the community in the "Let's Talk Bitcoin" podcast and was helped by Adam Levine to create a Counterparty token that [represented crowdfunding for her music](https://sonicscoop.com/bitcoin-musicians-tatiana-moroz-makes-case-artist-coins/). [TATIANACOIN](https://xchain.io/asset/TATIANACOIN) is considered "the first musical artist coin and the alpha for the concept of artist tokens". Owning this coin meant you were funding the recording of Tatiana’s “Keep The Faith” album. The album cover is made from the original signed artwork by [Ross Ulbricht](https://freeross.org/) while he was in prison. He gave it to her as a birthday gift. As mentioned on [her website](https://www.tatianamoroz.com/tatiana-coin/), "From as early as 2015, Tatiana had conceived of a token that would contain her combined music and artwork. She minted a run of 100 tokens for this purpose in 2015. Then in 2017, she minted tokens to contain all her albums to date. These include the TATIANAMOROZ (100 coins), minted Oct 10, 2015 and the TATIANAALBUM (900 coins), minted on Feb 10, 2017, among others." Tatiana would also be referenced later in a Spells of Genesis card designed around her story and musical background called [TATIANACARD](https://xchain.io/asset/TATIANACARD).

Date: **Jun 12, 2014**

Timeline Asset/Project: **OLGA**

Significance: [OLGA](https://xchain.io/asset/OLGA) was the first asset to be truly "Non Fungible" using Counterparty as it is a 1/1 piece that is not divisible into smaller units. This asset also contained significant intention and meaning. OLGA was used as a gesture of love whereby [JP Janssen](https://twitter.com/jp_janssen) dedicated a token to his sweetheart ‘Olga’ with the additional text stating ‘My Eternal One & Only'. It is also the first Token to include a non-English language as well as non-ASCII characters. Approximately a year later (August 2015) he added a message (using the Broadcast function) to the metadata in base64 format which contained an image of a light pencil drawing of them kissing. This is considered one of the first assets with a text description, and with the metadata added in August of 2015, OLGA is also considered [the first "Image Embedded NFT"](https://jpjanssen.com/faq-about-olga/) on the Counterparty protocol. JP also added a message along with the image which translates to: "My dear eternal Olga! Congratulations on your birthday!". The theory behind using these functions and formats was so the data would be saved 'on-chain' and accessible without any exterior links, and of course, to express that there is only one OLGA.

Timeline Asset/Project: **SEBUH**

Significance: Even though [SEBUH](https://xchain.io/asset/SEBUH) was minted 2 days before on June 13, 2014, the updating of the description with { ";image";: ";http://sebuh.com/images"; } was the first instance of a token including an image reference with a Counterparty Asset. The description has been changed since and now links to "sebuh.com". At the time [Sebuh](https://twitter.com/Sebuh_com) used this locked, non-divisible asset and [sold them for 0.144 BTC](https://forums.counterparty.io/t/ann-sebuh-token-rockminer-rbox-group-buy-and-investment-option/327) in which you could redeem the SEBUH tokens for a RBox Rockminer through his website. Years later in 2022 he stated "a collector messaged me on Facebook. He was after some really old Bitcoin miners. We traded a few miners with them for SEBUH tokens. So I shipped a Prospero X1, Ice fury, Redfury, and Technobit NF1, to Equador. It's now part of a museum." This token is also considered one of the earliest tokens to include a physical item related to a Counterparty Asset. Learn more about Sebuh and [his story here](https://youtu.be/06EgYWxpxzw).

Date: **Jun 28, 2014**

Timeline Asset/Project: **JPJA**

Significance: [JPJA](https://xchain.io/asset/JPJA) is one of the first tokens to give "shares" for a separate outside product within a Counterparty Asset. On June 28th the description of JPJA was changed to "1 share = 1 % of eBook tips. See JPJA.net" which provided a way to 'own' a piece of an eBook titled 'The Economics of Bitcoin' by JP Janssen. This is also the [first reference to an eBook](https://jpjanssen.com/jpja-2014-book-nft-defi-pioneer/) on any Counterparty Transaction or Asset. This was published on [the Bitcointalk forums](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=395761.msg7542184#msg7542184) as an experiment and funds were distributed to holders according to terms set on the asset.

Date: **Jul 2, 2014**

Timeline Asset/Project: **Counterparty BitBowl**

Significance: Containing a set of 32 tokens representing each team in the NFL, the [BitBowl](http://counterbowl.com/) was one of the first instances of tokens issued for the purpose of sports wagering or gambling in general. It was announced on the [Bitcointalk forums](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=735356.0) in August of 2014, but many of the tokens were minted a month prior in preparation for the BitBowl. The token list includes asset names that are the exact names of football teams like [CARDINALS](https://xchain.io/asset/CARDINALS) or [BRONCOS](https://xchain.io/asset/BRONCOS), but one token was already taken which was the 'Bears token' and it was represented by the asset: [BEARSB](https://xchain.io/asset/BEARSB).

Timeline Asset/Project: **FLDC**

Significance: The [FoldingCoin initiative](https://foldingcoin.net/) was created by Stanford University and allowed individuals to contribute their spare processing power to simulate complex protein folding. The project rewards contributors in the token [FLDC](https://xchain.io/asset/FLDC) to keep track for their contributions to research which can potentially lead to the creation of life saving drugs and treatments for an array of diseases and illnesses. In order to mine FoldingCoin, a user has to download FoldingCoin client over Folding@Home network and configure accordingly.

Timeline Asset/Project: **BEEP**

Significance: Each unit of this unique Counterparty token, named [BEEP](https://xchain.io/asset/BEEP), was made to be a token that could always be redeemed for a unique sound. This token was minted by Theo Goodman and the original directions to redeem your 'unique sound' was to send the BEEP to [a specific address](https://xchain.io/address/1CxNRJ8SANWxoAxyRaovBX8HD5159TSEYM), in which you would receive an "echo". In the original [bitcoin talk forum post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=729719.msg8248468#msg8248468) the directions gave [an example transaction](https://blockchain.info/de/tx/16e6a4ab91bcae64e6320a5202160c8bb678affe5ca3fe8d80f7db8a6796fad1) which contained a sample transaction for the echo effect to show interested users. The user was then to take the base64 included in that echo and play the file in a program that converted that specific information into a unique sound. This is a very interesting and early proof of concept of 'token controlled access' while also integrating a unique base64 code on-chain for the 'echo' of this BEEP token. At this time the access to this token supply is lost and no counterparty blockchain data was associated with BEEP and the directions mentioned. It definitely was a unique chord struck in Counterparty asset history and one of the first to theorize base64 and musical integration on the Counterparty platform.

Date: **Jul 11, 2014**

Timeline Asset/Project: **SJCX**

Significance: The [STORJ](https://www.storj.io/) project was originally backed on the [SJCX](https://xchain.io/asset/SJCX) token on Counterparty. SJCX was the original utility token for the project, which was used to pay node operators for sharing hard drive space and bandwidth on the Storj network. It could also be used by customers to pay for usage of the distributed storage network. Unfortunately, when the BTC mining fees became very high at one point around 2017, it became very expensive to send payouts to thousands of node operators every month so the project leaders decided to migrate the token to Ethereum which at the time had low gas fees. Storj still openly thanks the Counterparty community for being there for their idea when it was originally established. This asset also historically became one of the 12 cryptocurrencies officially [approved of by the Japanese government in 2017](https://www.techinasia.com/japan-approved-crypto-exchanges) and was also used for 'token controlled access' to a section on the Let's Talk Bitcoin website.

Let's Talk Bitcoin host, Adam Levine [posted on the Let's Talk Bitcoin blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20221206125716/https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/tcv) an overview of this system titled "Token Controlled Viewpoint (TCV) Genesis, Characteristics and Early Use Cases".

Timeline Asset/Project: **FFLTEAMA** 

Significance: This is a very interesting sports related betting project setup by Joe Looney and [Let's Talk Bitcoin](https://web.archive.org/web/20230131224146/https://letstalkbitcoin.com/) which rewarded users for betting on the owner of a fantasy football team. The teams and football side was taken care of with the Yahoo Fantasy Football service, while the finances and asset creation was done with the Counterparty Protocol. The tokens [FFLTEAMA](https://xchain.io/asset/FFLTEAMA) through [FFLTEAMN](https://xchain.io/asset/FFLTEAMN) represent an individual Fantasy Football Team (A through N) which you could bet on and possibly receive a return on. Though that was only true if the team did well enough that season. The return on investment was through the LTBCOIN token. Adam Terwilliger wrote in this [Let's Talk Bitcoin article](https://web.archive.org/web/20230128025524/http://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/investing-in-fantasy-is-reality) about the experience of owning a team in this fashion: "I have also given someone, who knows very little about fantasy sports, the ability to invest in an experienced fantasy sports competitor. They can check out my profile, look at my body of work, and ultimately decide my worth to their investment." Check out the results of that specific season [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20161118004726/http://joelooney.org/ltbcoin/ffl/).

The book even has a defined [economic model](https://web.archive.org/web/20141006184421/http://www.zigler.us/Bookbag/index.html). The book was titled ["Order of the Bookbag"](https://web.archive.org/web/20141006184421/http://www.zigler.us/Bookbag/bookbag.html) and was the first book in a series.

Significance: SPONSORLTB was used for an advertising spot (sponsored segment) during a future show of the [Let's Talk Bitcoin Podcast](https://web.archive.org/web/20220820033109/https://anchor.fm/originalltb) which was the main podcast related to the [Let's Talk Bitcoin website](https://web.archive.org/web/20230131224146/https://letstalkbitcoin.com/). This is a very early use of 'token gated access' for reserving advertisements related to a Counterparty token, though this token seems to have been less used than LTBDISPLAY due to its blockchain data. The description simply stated: "krystal@letstalkbitcoin.com to redeem".

Timeline Asset/Project: **BKEYCHAINUSA**

Significance: A man by the name of Rob Mitchell, who hosted [The Bitcoin Game](https://soundcloud.com/the-bitcoin-game) podcast in affiliation with [LetsTalkBitcoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=712944.0), minted BKEYCHAINUSA with the intention to sell a physical Bitcoin keychain within the USA. The description on the token reads: "Bkeychain.com Keychain mailed to USA". These tokens could be exchanged for the keychain which Rob was producing and [selling through Amazon](https://web.archive.org/web/20130717041542/http://www.amazon.com/Bkeychain-Bit-Key-01-Bitcoin-Keychain/dp/B00DJWEVHE), and [his website](https://bkeychain.com/). Adam Mcbride wrote in [this medium article](https://adamamcbride.medium.com/2014-keychain-tokens-146b69f0f605), "[Rob] was also very interested in what use cases tokens could have in solving real-world problems". At the time, Rob had a company called Paperclip Robot that sold Bitcoin keychains, but BKEYCHAIN and BKEYCHAINUSA were special in the case that they were sold on a [LetsTalkBitcoin auction](https://web.archive.org/web/20150808000217/http://auction.letstalkbitcoin.com/auction/5-bitcoin-keychain-tokens-us-intl-shipping-incl-2) and represented a separate way to distribute these keychains. This was one of the first use cases for a physical object connected to a Counterparty token. The difference between [BKEYCHAIN](https://xchain.io/asset/BKEYCHAIN) and [BKEYCHAINUSA](https://xchain.io/asset/BKEYCHAINUSA) is simply the fact that one token was for international shipping and the other was for shipping within the USA. There were also tokens by Rob, with the same names and same function [minted to Dogeparty](https://dogeparty.xchain.io/tx/158643) in September of 2014.

Significance: This asset was used to reserve one week of display advertisements on the [Let's Talk Bitcoin website](https://web.archive.org/web/20230131224146/https://letstalkbitcoin.com/). It is a very early use of 'token gated access' for accessing features on the LTB website and may be one of the first assets for reserving advertisements related to a Counterparty token.

Significance: [TopCoin](https://domaingang.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/topcoin-whitepaper.pdf) is a Counterparty project created by Josh Jones, co-founder of DreamHost, and his partner Michael Blend. Consumers are rewarded [TOPCOIN](https://xchain.io/asset/TOPCOIN) for domain name purchases made at partner companies in the Topcoin ecosystem, and those companies in turn accept up to half the purchase price of new domain name registrations in TOPCOIN at a value of $1 per TOPCOIN. The closest “real-world” analogy to this [use case of a Counterparty Token](https://counterparty.io/news/counterparty-update-070416/) is frequent flyer miles, except that Topcoin may be used across a broad range of product classes and are easily exchanged for other currencies.

Timeline Asset/Project: **NILI**

Significance: Artist, [Nili Lerner](https://twitter.com/NILIcoins), released in September of 2014 a very early and historical "NILIcoins" project which included tokens to represent proportional ownership of her artwork. The project consisted of 11 tokens: 7 brandname tokens referencing popart, 3 social art tokens and 1 [NILI](https://xchain.io/asset/NILI) representing ownership of physical art. She mentioned, "The tokens were also made to illustrated different future monetary models yet were created as the art objects itself". She also stated on [the debut Bitcointalk post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=782161.0) that NILIcoins were created to "promote a competitive credit-provides ecosystem". Nili went on to [explain on her Twitter](https://twitter.com/NILIcoins/status/1646200552278171648) that these tokens "are created and sold as crypto art objects, not a as a financial asset. 80% of most tokens will not be available to own privately (only as holding and as part of a DAO)."

Date: **Oct 7, 2014**

Timeline Asset/Project: **Overstock**

Significance: Originally [posted on the Counterparty website](https://counterparty.io/news/counterparty-and-overstock-to-create-decentralized-stock-exchange/), CEO of Overstock.com Patrick Byrne decided to hire Counterparty Developers to create a blockchain based system for Overstock. They created a project code-named Medici, which was a "front-end and portal to the decentralized stock exchange of the Counterparty platform". Since the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange had become popular at this time, this cryptographic layer aimed to re-create the DEx while also going through a private process of regulatory compliance. In [this Coindesk article](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/07/overstock-hires-counterparty-developers-to-build-cryptosecurity-stock-exchange/) Byrne said, "[Counterparty] is true to the ethics of bitcoin, true to the open-source nature, they're true to the principles."
While this venture was [closed in April of 2021](https://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstock-closes-transaction-pelion-venture-partners-oversee), Overstock stated in the press release, "We remain bullish on blockchain technology and are excited for Medici Ventures to enter this new post-closing phase" and also go on to mention they would be shifting focus to their "core e-commerce business".

Timeline Asset/Project: **UMBRELLA**

Significance: [LiteBit](https://twitter.com/LiteBitCo) came up with the idea to mint 600 [UMBRELLA](https://xchain.io/asset/UMBRELLA) tokens to represent a 'right-to-claim voucher' for a physical umbrella that he would batch order later in time. He posted the token and idea on the Bitcointalk forums. The idea was to make an orange bitcoin umbrella to stand out in the sea of black umbrellas throughout the world. On Nov 13, 2014 the description "bitcoinumbrellas.com" was added for users to be redirected for their purchase to that website. It is considered one of the first assets on the Counterparty Protocol to represent a physical object that could be purchased. The art for this piece (by M0d3D3b0) and it's subasset ([UMBRELLA.ORIGINS](https://xchain.io/asset/UMBRELLA.ORIGINS)) was added at a later date. LiteBit commented later saying he also considered this asset to be an early type of crowdfunding project as well.

The creator, Daniel Peled, stated that companies like Whatsapp and Facebook are making money selling information to advertisers and that on GEMS "the messaging side is just like any other messaging application, we use a server infrastructure, but the ownership and the reward model is built using blockchain technology". The Counterparty token used in relation to this project was [GEMZ](https://xchain.io/asset/GEMZ).

Timeline Asset/Project: **MYSOUL**

Significance: Artist, [Rhea Myers](https://twitter.com/rheaplex/) tokenized her soul conceptually with the asset MYSOUL on the Counterparty platform. She had done this minting as well on the Dogeparty Protocol [a few days prior](https://dogeparty.xchain.io/tx/26551) with the same asset name. She simply put in the description of both "My soul." Not a single MYSOUL was ever traded nor did the Asset Ownership ever change hands on either chain it was minted. Rhea still holds the entire supply of her soul. She commented [on Twitter](https://x.com/rheaplex/status/1719562194139132404?s=20), "They weren’t sold because my wife objected". Rhea was an early innovator with art and blockchain and [many of her works](https://rhea.art/art/index.html) are seen as artistic milestones in the cryptocurrency community.

Date: **Feb 6, 2015**

Timeline Asset/Project: **BITCRYSTALS**

Significance: [BITCRYSTALS](https://crystalsuite.com/bitcrystals/) was used for one of the first successful ICOs back in 2015 and is used in the game [Spells of Genesis](https://spellsofgenesis.com/). From the initial supply of 100,000,000 units, 30% were kept by EverdreamSoft, the token issuer, and the remaining 70% were offered on sale during the “BitCrystals Token Sale”. As stated on the official website "BitCrystals (BCY) is the official currency of Crystal Suite. They are distributed for users’ engagement in the Crystal Suite products, but also in partners’ games." This asset's supply would eventually be partially burned and released on the ERC-20 contract on Ethereum as well. The company stated they did this "in order to adapt the coin to our current multi-chain product strategy." This asset also historically became one of the 12 cryptocurrencies officially [approved of by the Japanese government in 2017](https://www.techinasia.com/japan-approved-crypto-exchanges). At the end of each month, the equivalent of 50% of the cards and in-game sales income in BCY is burnt.

Timeline Asset/Project: **Digital-Asset-Backed Artworks by weex**

Significance: As published in this [original Bitcointalk forum post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=954740), an artist by the name of 'weex' explained he created a set of 1/1 numeric assets minted using the Counterparty protocol to represent 12 separate physical artworks. The artwork in these pieces used a graffiti stencil type style that included the Bitcoin logo. The digital image was published openly for download but the Counterparty asset associated and the physical that went with it were sold for $50 (plus shipping) per individual piece at the time. None of these 12 assets could be considered "first" or "before the other" because they were all minted at the same time in [the same BTC block](https://xchain.io/tx/169170). This is one of the first instances in the world of 1/1 NFT art with physical tokens associated with it in a series and might be the first to do so with numeric Counterparty assets. The tokens in this series are: [A1268036952489992000](https://xchain.io/asset/A1268036952489992000), [A7714010038065172000](https://xchain.io/asset/A7714010038065172000), [A16665771309720693000](https://xchain.io/asset/A16665771309720693000), [A2482034434046493000](https://xchain.io/asset/A2482034434046493000), [A10757775179751730000](https://xchain.io/asset/A10757775179751730000), [A2382890405647249000](https://xchain.io/asset/A2382890405647249000), [A5276228097108709000](https://xchain.io/asset/A5276228097108709000), [A520544706094163650](https://xchain.io/asset/A520544706094163650), [A12286573536304806000](https://xchain.io/asset/A12286573536304806000), [A11433176278603567000](https://xchain.io/asset/A11433176278603567000), [A305220116359788860](https://xchain.io/asset/A305220116359788860) and [A4727714767834463000](https://xchain.io/asset/A4727714767834463000).

Date: **Mar 9, 2015**

Timeline Asset/Project: **GRUMPYCAT**

Significance: This Counterparty asset, [GRUMPYCAT](https://xchain.io/asset/GRUMPYCAT), was minted as "a fun asset that [was] used to demonstrate the [coindaddy.io](https://coindaddy.io/) asset services". At the time this was issued, the Coindaddy service offered an 'asset vending machine service' similar to the same basic functionality as dispensers (which are active currently on the Counterparty Protocol). Except in this situation you could pay with any XCP or XDP asset/token. This service not in operation today, but was at that time. The vending machine service was a service where people deposited their tokens into a main vending machine hot-wallet. Then the user would setup rules to listen for payments to addresses they configured, and then dispense a token using the Coindaddy 3rd-party service.

Date: **Mar 11, 2015**

Timeline Asset/Project: **FDCARD**

Significance: Arguably the historical holy grail of tokenized assets within the Counterparty community. It is the first digital game collectable ever tokenized to Counterparty (and was before Ethereum went live). [FDCARD](https://xchain.io/asset/FDCARD) is card #1 within the Spells of Genesis game which was the first game to leverage blockchain for in game assets (aside from currency purposes). The FDCARD is also one of the first instances of tokenized cryptoart, especially in a curated collection. The artist of FDCARD was Alejandro Hurtado, but other artists contributed to the art in the project such as Ryo Feugere, Andrew Fairhurst, Ramsès Melèndez and Herckeim. Many of the pieces in the collection reference cryptocurrency culture at the time of minting. The company EverdreamSoft, founded by Shaban Shaame, leveraged the Counterparty platform to tokenize a series of assets on the bitcoin blockchain for use in their game Spells of Genesis which still remains active today. FDCARD was originally distributed to participants of the innovative [FoldingCoin project](https://foldingcoin.net/) as a reward for contributing their idle computational power. The original tokenized assets are now highly sought after collectibles and regarded as historical artifacts that pioneered the emergence of this entire new asset class and the associated industries, events, artists and economies.

Date: **Mar 16, 2015**

Timeline Asset/Project: **SCARAB**

Significance: According to [the official website](https://www.thescarabexperiment.org/): "[SCARAB](https://xchain.io/asset/SCARAB) is a mass multi-user persona linked to a decentralized artist collective through a cryptocurrency token. In order for the process to work, members must hold a Scarab Token in a linked account so that they can vote. SCARAB creates a work of art through an algorithmic imaging method process for every 1,000 artworks submitted. Using this process each artwork is integrated with the artwork submitted before it and every thousandth submission ends the cycle by sending the image out for fabrication producing a single artwork of SCARAB." This process was originally intended to produce a quantity of 50 unique, community made works of art. Those 50 tokens are represented by the [SCARABART](https://xchain.io/asset/SCARABART) token. This project, like other Counterparty projects, [was originally published](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1822809.0) on the Bitcointalk forums.

Significance: [XCPinata](https://www.xcpinata.com/) was a very early pixel art collection on Counterparty. [CUPCAKE](https://xchain.io/asset/CUPCAKE) is the first asset of this collection and was minted by Kevin Ferreira. Kevin chose to start minting his art onto the blockchain much earlier than this project, but this one specifically lives on Counterparty. He looked to give collectors of his art automatic drops and rewards for holding these tokens. Using the Counterparty protocol, it was easy to do so. His theory was to "share the thinking that art is a token in and of itself".

Timeline Asset/Project: **BLACKBOX**

Significance: Blackbox is a unique art project established in 2021 by Jdog with the goal of helping promote donations to Counterparty and the developer community. The goal was also to bring Counterparty token awareness and usefulness while bringing it to a larger audience through a unique blend of grassroots efforts and guerrilla marketing. Owning a [BLACKBOX](https://xchain.io/asset/BLACKBOX) token or its subasset derivitaves shows user participation in the project and support for the community. These tokens are usually for things like [The Counterparty General Fund](https://xchain.io/asset/BLACKBOX.Counterparty_General_Fund), [Funding for Xchain servers](https://xchain.io/asset/BLACKBOX.Xchain_Server_Hosting), specific [Counterparty Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips) [Funding](https://xchain.io/asset/BLACKBOX.CIP03), funding for the [Counterparty Community Manager](https://xchain.io/asset/BLACKBOX.2021.Community_Outreach_Manager), and other token initiatives that enable users to donate to specific improvements or currently running sub-structures of the Counterparty Community. Holding these tokes also incentivizes token rewards and other special access to new features down the road in the Counterparty Community which only BLACKBOX token holders will get to fully participate in and appreciate.

Timeline Asset/Project: **SATOSHICARD**

Significance: Through a collaboration between [Spells of Genesis](https://spellsofgenesis.com/) and [SaruTobi](https://mandelduck.com/sarutobi/), the [SATOSHICARD](https://xchain.io/asset/SATOSHICARD) is recognized as the oldest tokenized metaverse asset on the Counterparty Protocol. SATOSHICARD was integrated into both of the two blockchain games by two different developers, providing different utility in each. This token is considered part of the humble birth of "metaverse" cryptographic tokens, and according to [Whiterabbit1111](https://whiterabbit1111.medium.com/the-origin-digital-antiquities-market-nfts-1ea9b69c03f9) SATOSHICARD "served to be the first crack in the walled gardens of the multibillion dollar gaming industry". The game itself was in beta by Sep 2016 and then released in May 2017. A few examples of tokens similar in functionality to SATOSHICARD include: SATOSHILITE — “The Imitator”, GOXCARD — “The stealing of Mountain Gox”, BLOCKSIZECD — “Battle for Block Size”, ETHERERUMCARD — “Sir of the Ether”, and many more.

Date: **Aug 6, 2015**

Timeline Asset/Project: **SALVATION**

Significance: This token, named [SALVATION](https://xchain.io/asset/SALVATION), was the first time Token Ownership Rights for a named assed was transferred to a burn address. Unlike A714159941780378900, the Token Ownership Rights were transferred and not the total supply. This, in effect was the first use of 'locking the description and locking any subasset's to be issued' while keeping the total supply liquid to buy/sell or move around. The Token Ownership Rights for SALVATION was sent to the vanity burn address: 1SaLvationGodsMarveLousGracaLgYQS. It was minted with the description stating "SAVE UR SOUL FROM SIN & ITS CONSEQUENCES".

Significance: [This](https://www.xcp.dev/asset/A18340712565681460000) is the first time an asset (named or alphabetical) was locked without minting a single token. In other words, the Alphabetical Token was created but no tokens were issued (0 supply) and then the creator locked the issuance so no tokens could ever be added. This would be considered a "Token Ownership Rights" only token with a 0 supply.

Timeline Asset/Project: **Weird n' Wild**

Significance: This trading card collection minted by [JP Janssen](https://twitter.com/jp_janssen) is not only one of the first instances of 'blockchain trading cards' but also is the first to include on-chain hash's of the artwork when minting. The first three cards in the series: [GENET](https://xchain.io/asset/GENET), [GRAYWOLF](https://xchain.io/asset/GRAYWOLF) and [LOCHNESS](https://xchain.io/asset/LOCHNESS) all have sha256 hashes of the card images broadcast with a truncated base64 representation of the data from the minting address. JP also went on to do this process for the first 26 Spells of Genesis cards after. He states on his website 'Of course, this was unofficial. I was not associated with Spells of Genesis. But I did create cryptographic proofs of the designs existing at the time, and I did show which images I, as a fan, considered to represent those tokens.' On [his website](https://jpjanssen.com/xcp-cards-a-2015-nft-project/) JP also explains and teaches you how to verify the images with the on-chain information in the broadcasts. This collection came out of a project called 'XCP CARDS' in which JP stated, 'An essential part of the project was to notarize all cards, meaning engraving hash proofs inside Bitcoin transactions'.

Date: **Dec 19, 2015**

Timeline Asset/Project: **SARUTOBICARD**

Significance: A young iOS developer in Australia by the name of [Christian Moss](https://twitter.com/MandelDuck) released a game on the App Store called [SaruTobi](https://mandelduck.com/sarutobi/) where players tapped the screen to spin a monkey to see how far they could get him to fly. Christian wanted to let SaruTobi players purchase in-game items with Bitcoin but Apple’s iOS App Store terms didn't allow it. Instead he let players collect small amounts of Bitcoin as they played. At the time, Christian was working with [IndieSquare](https://indiesquare.co.jp/) on wallet implementation and helping with the development of [Book of Orbs](https://www.bookoforbs.com/index_eng.html). In June of 2016, Christian implemented this blockchain functionality by making the [Spells of Genesis](https://spellsofgenesis.com/) SATOSHICARD, [SARUTOBICARD](https://xchain.io/asset/SARUTOBICARD), and CNPCARD playable in Sarutobi. These three assets marked the first instances of a Counterparty tokenized asset becoming interoperable between two independent games. SARUTOBICARD in this circumstance would be singled out to be a cultural and tokenized representation of SaruTobi and eventually a separate game called [SaruTobi's Island](https://mandelduck.com/sarutobiisland/) which allowed players to use proof of ownership of Counterparty assets to generate playable characters in SaruTobi's Island. Christian noted about the decision saying, "Koji mentioned a japanese game called Monster Farmer, where you could generate monsters by putting any CD in your game system", which inspired Christian to "give some utility to any token a user may have".

Date: **Jan 6, 2016**

Timeline Asset/Project: **MTM Series**

Significance: The [Mind To Matter series](https://www.mtmseries.io/) is a collection of tokens which are considered one the first examples of true cryptographic music ownership (or music NFT's) on the Counterparty protocol. The tokens included were [MTMALBUM](https://xchain.io/asset/MTMALBUM), [MTMPRODUCER](https://xchain.io/asset/MTMPRODUCER), [MTMCOLLECTOR](https://xchain.io/asset/MTMCOLLECTOR) and [MTMSONG](https://xchain.io/asset/MTMSONG) which represented tokenized ownership of Adam B. Levine's EP titled "A Little Color". The process included buying and owning one of the tokens above to access Adam's album. At the time the cost was either $5 in bitcoin, $7 with credit/debit, $2.50 worth of LTBCOIN and a couple other payment options. It was an early use of 'token controlled access' that allowed token holders to prove they held the token to access the music.

Date: **May 6, 2016**

Timeline Asset/Project: **NINJASUIT**

Significance: [NINJASUIT](https://xchain.io/asset/NINJASUIT) is the first Counterparty asset specifically native to the game [SaruTobi](https://mandelduck.com/sarutobi/ninja/) and would eventually be realized as the first NFT gaming 'skin', the first NFT power-up and it marked the first instance of an NFT being used in a play-to-earn game. [Christian Moss](https://twitter.com/MandelDuck) realized that he could 'link a user's Counterparty mobile wallet to SaruTobi and the app would be able to read what tokens they had in their wallet. Based on their token inventory NINJASUIT could grant access to various features in the game.' The art on the token represented the power-up that could be used in game which was involved a double-jump where the in game character, 'instead of falling will jump mid-air giving you another chance'.

Significance: This [blockchain based project](https://web.archive.org/web/20180106173743/http://www.blocksafefoundation.com/index.html#what_we_do ) titled 'Blocksafe' aimed at cryptographic tracking and token representation of firearms. The original token on Counterparty, [TRIGGERS](https://xchain.io/asset/TRIGGERS), was the start of a inventory process of an individual ownership or state ownership of guns. The project stated this process "can anonymously reduce gang activity, locate stolen firearms, prevent malignant gun use and more". TRIGGERS was also publicly traded on Bittrex for a short time, though as [stated in the whitepaper](https://web.archive.org/web/20180127200858/http://www.blocksafefoundation.com/assets/blocksafe_whitepaper_v.1.pdf) this project would eventually convert to using ERC20 tokens later.

Timeline Asset/Project: **Takara**

Significance: [Takara](https://blog.indiesquare.me/bitcoin-geocaching-app-takara-integrates-counterparty-tokens-through-indiesquare-api-bfe1b82bf4a4) was launched in the summer of 2016 and was Bitcoin's first ever 'geocatching App'. It used the Counterparty Protocol and the [IndieSquare](https://indiesquare.co.jp/ ) API to 'drop' Counterparty user created tokens and Bitcoin anywhere in the world. This means if a user went to the location the asset was dropped, they could 'find' the asset and it would be delivered to their account. This app was [very popular](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/counterparty-and-bitcoin-apps-have-fun-with-crypto-1470761687) and had many downloads on IOS as well as Android and at its peak it included assets from many Counterparty projects including Spells of Genesis, Rare Pepe and many others.

Timeline Asset/Project: **WILLCOIN**

Significance: [Force of Will](https://www.fowtcg.com/) is a Japanese fantasy series with a physical trading card game included. Each set of cards also included "chapters" of the overall story series. In August of 2016, FoW combined IndieSquare’s Counterparty API services with EverdreamSoft’s dashboard for game management and asset registration. FoW utilized blockchain game items and planted the seed for a generation of games and applications with interoperable assets and items. Eiji Shishido, CEO of Force of Will, [explained the decision to use Counterparty protocol](https://www.econotimes.com/TCG-Force-of-Will-partners-with-two-Counterparty-based-projects-to-launch-blockchain-based-online-simulator-next-month-264564) stating, “The borderless nature of blockchain technology inspired us. FoW is not an online game currently but we wanted to bring in a new value to the game industry. We wanted to offer FoW players a whole new experience and the new value proposition based on the cutting edge technology.” Force of Will released their cards as tokenized assets along with a currency ‘WILLCOIN’ on bitcoin via Counterparty. It had been intended that a game would be launched in which the assets could be used, however the game never eventuated.

Date: **Sep 9, 2016**

Timeline Asset/Project: **RAREPEPE**

Significance: Looking through a historical lens, [RAREPEPE](https://xchain.io/asset/RAREPEPE) is considered an integral part of the birth of the global cryptoart movement as it is the first project on Counterparty to invite any artist from anywhere in the world to participate. The project centers around a central theme of an internet meme called 'Pepe' that was originally a character in a comic titled "Boy's Club" by Matt Furie. Some of the [initial posts about this project](https://web.archive.org/web/20191105144553/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1617264.0) came from the Bitcointalk forums. The project was closed in February of 2018 ending with 1774 different distinct pieces of art regarded as [The Rare Pepe Directory](http://rarepepedirectory.com/). Many include references to cryptocurrency culture, internet culture and culture in general. This was also the case as per the art in Spells of Genesis, but this time from many different artists. Many projects emulating this 'open arms artist invitation' have been created since including, but not limited to: 'Fake Rares' and 'Dank Rares'. Series 1, Card 1 of The Rare Pepe Directory is titled "[RAREPEPE](https://xchain.io/asset/RAREPEPE)" and was minted by a user named 'Mike' with the description stating: "The most rare pepe that has ever existed". RAREPEPE is the genesis card in the collection. While there is reference to 'Pepe' in a previous token description named CLIO, RAREPEPE was the first to include Pepe artwork on a Counterparty token and definitely [wasn't the last to do so](https://www.counterfeitsuperfakes.wtf/).

Date: **Sep 17, 2016**

Timeline Asset/Project: **PEPECASH**

Significance: Early on, in the first series of the [Rare Pepe Directory](http://rarepepedirectory.com/), it was theorized to have a project centered currency to trade against all the cards from all the artists in the directory. Since many tokens were already being sold against XCP and since the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange supported 'asset-for-asset' trading pairs, [PEPECASH](https://xchain.io/asset/PEPECASH) became the currency of exchange for trading Rare Pepe's in the community. It was also a card in the directory itself with minted art by Mike. PEPECASH was originally distributed to holders of RAREPEPE, GOXPEPE, AND SHITCOINCARD. A portion of PEPECASH was also donated to FoldingCoin miners. After some giveaways on Twitter and in [the Rare Pepe Telegram chat](https://t.me/+RHJ6MDMME545MDk5), the rest was burned, which ended up being about 300 Million units. This card was also used to submit cards into the directory from that point on, though you were required to send it to [a specific burn address](https://xchain.io/address/1BurnPepexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAK33R) to do so. These trading theories were done because this project predates the 'destroy' function as well as the 'dispenser' function. This asset also historically became one of the 12 cryptocurrencies officially [approved of by the Japanese government in 2017](https://www.techinasia.com/japan-approved-crypto-exchanges). It is not uncommon for more recent projects to still use PEPECASH, for instance the [Fake Rares 'Commons'](https://fakeraredirectory.com/fake-commons/) section requires a 'destruction' of PEPECASH for submission.

Date: **Sep 22, 2016**

Timeline Asset/Project: **FEELSGOODMAN**

Significance: This is the official asset that was reserved for the original Pepe artist named Matt Furie. It was intended by the creator of Rare Pepe (Mike) to always reserve a place for the comic artist who created the Pepe character. When it was issued in 2016 by Joe Looney, the image shown read "Reserved for Matt Furie". In September of 2021, Matt Furie requested ownership of [FEELSGOODMAN](https://xchain.io/asset/FEELSGOODMAN) and was given the asset ownership by Joe. Matt then updated the image with his art submission and distributed it on his own terms [via his Pegz DAO](https://www.pegz.fun/) which did cause some public backlash [and a lawsuit](https://www.vice.com/en/article/dypj37/rare-pepe-nft-is-not-rare-enough-dollar500k-lawsuit-alleges).

Significance: The Rare Pepe collection spawned a significant amount of experimentation on Counterparty, one of which was [UFOPEPE](https://xchain.io/asset/UFOPEPE). This card is considered the first GIF to be linked to a Counterparty asset. It was minted by a user named 'Mike' who was the creator and curator (sometimes called 'scientist') of the collection. While there was a token created before that mentioned 'gif' named MEMETOKEN, UFOPEPE is the first true use of a piece of artwork in GIF format that was minted with the token originally.

Timeline Asset/Project: **RAREPEPEPRTY**

Significance: This asset, [RAREPEPEPRTY](https://xchain.io/asset/RAREPEPEPRTY), is not only an accepted submission into the [Rare Pepe Directory](http://rarepepedirectory.com/), but is also the token that represents shares in a game called [Rare Pepe Party](https://web.archive.org/web/20210506073100/http://rarepepe.party/). This project aimed to use some specific cards in the directory that were minted by John Villar to be included in a digital trading card game. This project also had a [Booster Sales Pack sales model](https://web.archive.org/web/20201031172141/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IVca73gSsnxtZTW1Qki-fIbgYNz7Ap-5oZZLtT-_-aM/edit) and a [business proposal](https://web.archive.org/web/20201031173413/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k8Dq6k4OHLD6NZ-qlwGjLYIq_ndVpopDolOXq7SjDuo/edit?usp=sharing). This game and project even saw great fame and hype when it was [mentioned by Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert](https://www.rt.com/shows/keiser-report/383416-episode-max-keiser-1053/). Still to this day, despite some recent updates given by the team, Rare Pepe Party is still not live to play at the time of this writing.

Date: **Oct 13, 2016**

Timeline Asset/Project: **DJPEPE**

Significance: This asset was a token of many "firsts" in the Counterparty Community. The first of which was to include a curated music playlist of original music written by Scrilla that could be listened to as 'token access controlled'. When a user proved they owned this specific Rare Pepe card in their [RarePepeWallet](https://rarepepewallet.com/) they could access the content. This included a playlist of original music by Scrilla, which would change periodically over time, and even include [pre-releases](https://youtu.be/ZG1H5uJwYt4) of songs before the general public had heard them. Within Joe Looney's RarePepeWallet, this feature was included as a 'Bonus Content' button in which you could access this content when you owned the DJPEPE token. When DJPEPE was accepted into the Rare Pepe Collection, it was the first to begin experimenting with attached content. Other tokens like [PEPENATION](https://xchain.io/asset/PEPENATION) for example, even though earlier in the series, added content at a later date. DJPEPE specifically is considered the first "audio-visual" tokenized asset on Counterparty because of the relation to the easily unlockable content and it's accompanying art in Rare Pepe, though it went on to do much more. [DJPEPE](https://xchain.io/asset/DJPEPE) has had its own [twitter account](https://twitter.com/DJPEPE_) since 2017, has attended [rare cryptocurrency events](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2018/01/23/much-pepe-scenes-first-rare-digital-art-auction/), has its own brand, has a variety of subassets created from the original token for various purposes, has live "DJ'd" events and has become a major meme personality within itself.

Significance: Minted by the legendary Counterparty Developer, John Villar, [PEPEBALT](https://xchain.io/asset/PEPEBALT) is the first token that included a playable game on a Counterparty asset itself. PEPEBALT is also a card in the [Rare Pepe Directory](http://rarepepedirectory.com/). Villar wrote on the card itself "It looks and acts like a game, but it isn't a game, it's just a tech demo".

Date: **Oct 26, 2016**

Timeline Asset/Project: **GORILLAGLUE**

Significance: After DJPEPE, Scrilla went on to make this specific asset which represented a music album and was given to people who purchased his mixtape titled, 'Gorilla Glue' mixtape. If a buyer bought the Limited Edition Mixtape and Cassette version on [his bandcamp sales page](https://rarescrilla.bandcamp.com/album/gorilla-glue-mixtape), they were given a code redeemable for a GORILLAGLUE. It was the first Counterparty musical token to directly represent a physical album purchase and was also used it as a proof of concept to pitch to [bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) on the idea of integrating tokens with their platform. After little response from bandcamp, Scrilla eventually even [minted the email sends and responses](https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/%E2%82%BF%E2%82%B3%E2%82%A6%C4%91%E2%82%B5%E2%82%B3%E2%82%A5%E2%82%B1-20660) to the SuperRare platform. The token itself even had the cover art for the mixtape attached at the time of issuance. GORILLAGLUE went on to be used in the [token.fm](https://web.archive.org/web/20220311051125/https://token.fm/) project as a proof of concept.

Date: **Dec 20, 2016**

Timeline Asset/Project: **BITGIRLS**

Significance: In 2016 and 2017 there was a [Japanese TV Show that aired in Tokyo](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/japanese-tv-show-bitgirls-brings-bitcoin-and-digital-currencies-to-the-masses-1476209323) and the surrounding area (14.3 million households) featuring Japanese women known as [‘BitGirls’](https://rarejapanesenfts.com/collection/bitgirls/). Episodes aired on a weekly basis, and participants could use Torekabu-nushi (Trading-share-card holders) to cast votes after each episode. The voting included having the girls wear different costumes and change standing positions during each show. Each girl’s performance on TV would affect her popularity, thus increasing or decreasing the value of her token, and influencing viewers’ trading behaviors. Investors could then trade the BitGirls currency on the Zaif exchange. This [early innovative approach](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-rebranding-in-japan-bitgirls-tv-show-to-sugarcoat-mtgox-drama) was effectively one of the earliest forms of ICOs or 'governance tokens' before a name had been given to that approach.

Significance: Minted by Theo Goodman, these tokens name [SUPERBOWLFAL](https://xchain.io/asset/SUPERBOWLFAL) and [SUPERBOWLPAT](https://xchain.io/asset/SUPERBOWLPAT) were one of the first uses of a [Counterparty based betting platform](https://theogoodman.medium.com/a-historic-super-bowl-87f8016e51b3). They were used for the 2017 American Football Super Bowl between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots. Owners of the winning team could redeem them on the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange using PEPECASH from the Rare Pepe project.

Timeline Asset/Project: **BPOLOSOMCXVI**

Significance: [The Diecast Club](https://collectablediecast.com/) is a popular supplier of physical miniature car models for collectors. The company was founded in 1988 as a family business and then bought out by Collectable Brands in 2017. The [interesting history behind this one](https://medium.com/book-of-orbs/takara-diecast-token-giveaway-campaign-details-14e5ffe6922d) is that EverdreamSoft (Spells of Genesis) and Collectable DieCast shared an office building during this early innovation period. After coming to understand each other’s business, it was agreed that an attempt would be made to transition the interest of collectors from the traditional physical medium to the digital realm by tokenizing their goods on the BTC blockchain via Counterparty. In order to draw [attention to these assets](https://medium.com/book-of-orbs/diecast-collaboration-and-orb-giveaways-99a6ff1b0c7f#.5rvu0v5se) and reward users, EverdreamSoft partnered with Christian Moss and coordinated an innovative distribution of some of these assets in connection with a geocaching app called Takara. The unusual method of distribution and innovation forged new ground in this new space of ‘air-dropping’ digital assets. The earliest minted token of this project is [BPOLOSOMCXVI](https://xchain.io/asset/BPOLOSOMCXVI) but the entire set features 18 one of kind tokens with 18 one of a kind cars that represent them.

Date: **Feb 11, 2017**

Timeline Project/Asset: **VICEPEPE**

Significance: While [this asset](https://xchain.io/asset/VICEPEPE) is a card in the [Rare Pepe Directory](http://rarepepedirectory.com/), it also holds a historical start and perspective of using a Counterparty Token to represent saving an internet link or article. [VICEPEPE](https://xchain.io/asset/VICEPEPE), minted by Scrilla, included an image that was pointing to a very real [VICE magazine article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/aejvdb/collectors-are-using-the-blockchain-to-keep-rare-pepes-rare) with the intention to save a piece of the record of this article existing on the internet. The fear was that this article might be removed from the internet at a future date and to cryptographically stamp it's existense. This theory of minting data of websites, articles and even social media pages 'to back them up' would be experimented with later in a project using Ethereum called [Marble Cards](https://marble.cards/whitepaper). A project in which any user could attach specific websites of the their choosing to a cryptographic token.

Date: **Feb 14, 2017**

Timeline Project/Asset: **BADHAIRDAY**

Significance: On December 2nd, 2016, a user made an invalid counterparty transaction of [HAIRPEPE](https://xchain.io/asset/HAIRPEPE) and because of an unforeseen bug in the code, this transaction caused counterparty nodes to crash. [Aya](https://twitter.com/ayaLAN), the artist of HAIRPEPE stated, "As people began to troubleshot what was wrong, it became known that HAIRPEPE was the cause of it, and the absurdity of it made it sort of a meme". Bitcointalk forum poster 'xnova' stated in [this post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1777955.msg17968298#msg17968298) that the more technical explanation of this issue was: "the parameters chosen for a HAIRPEPE order hit up on an obscure bug where the calculated integer value chosen for the order quantity was higher than the max integer value for sqllite, but equal to the max int value used in the python validation code (they differed by 1). Thus, the value was not further limited in the sanity check code, and when the daemon was attempting to store the record in sqllite it caused an exception." The user, novax, went on to say that because of this mishap "we now handle this situation in a way that should avoid this kind of issue in the future anywhere in the code." The asset that references this day was minted by Joe Looney and is named: [BADHAIRDAY](https://xchain.io/asset/BADHAIRDAY). This artwork, which resembles a HAIRPEPE as a 'cog in the XCP machine' is also an official card in the [Rare Pepe Directory](http://rarepepedirectory.com/).

Timeline Project/Asset: **KEEPSAKE**

Significance: This '[Proof of Visit](https://proofofvisit.com/)' project invited users to mint Counterparty tokens to represent being at a specific location in the world. Instead of postcards or souveniers, this idea aimed to timestamp and 'geostamp' a location of an individual digitally on a cryptographic token to prove the user actually was at a specific location. These tokens, like [KEEPSAKE](https://xchain.io/asset/KEEPSAKE) and [PROOFOFVISIT](https://xchain.io/asset/PROOFOFVISIT) could be collected, sent and even traded.

Timeline Asset/Project: **WACKNAKAMOTO**

Significance: [Memorychain](https://medium.com/@coin_and_peace/history-of-vintage-nfts-in-japan-the-almost-forgotten-part-of-nft-history-5f15ce50a828) was a Japanese user-generated content collection aiming at depicting and commemorating significant events, people or projects in the blockchain industry. There were multiple artists and a community telegram that curated and voted on submissions. Information about this early community and project is hard to come by now. However these amazing artworks that are laden with blockchain history are left as valuable relics from this period. The first asset of the collection was [WACKNAKAMOTO](https://rarejapanesenfts.com/nft/wacknakamoto/). Lead innovator [Koji Hagigashi](https://twitter.com/coin_and_peace?lang=en) has recently [written an article](https://medium.com/@coin_and_peace/history-of-vintage-nfts-in-japan-the-almost-forgotten-part-of-nft-history-5f15ce50a828) and [developed an explorer](https://rarejapanesenfts.com) providing some amazing insight into this early project and others.

Timeline Asset/Project: **RUSTBITS**

Significance: The [Age of Rust](https://www.ageofrustgame.com/) video game is a 'thrilling single-player sci-fi adventure filled with danger and intrigue' and was originally intended to use Counterparty assets for features to be unlocked in the game. The Counterparty token [RUSTBITS](https://xchain.io/asset/RUSTBITS) was used within the game itself 'to unlock abilities, secret areas, and crypto rewards for players'. Proving ownership of not only RUSTBITS, but other cards like [ROGUEMECH](https://xchain.io/asset/ROGUEMECH) (the oldest in the series of 7 separate cards) gave the player unique 'token accessed' content within the game. While the tokens were originally minted on the Counterparty platform, during a period of very large transaction fees on Bitcoin, the team decided to use Enjin and eventually the Polygon platform to distribute and entangle the token ownership with the game. Age of Rust published a beta playtest on the Steam platform but it was removed in October of 2021. On their website, the team mentioned that 'Steam decided to remove Age of Rust from the Steam platfrom because NFTs can be sold for real-world currency off their platform. [Steam] has also updated their terms to block blockchain and NFTs from using the platform.' At the moment, it looks like the game will be released again on the Epic Games platform soon and will only be avaliable to play if a user proves they own a specific 'Privateer NFT' (which is yet to be minted and distributed). The team mentioned that 'there is no need to purchase the game separately, as long as you have a Privateer NFT, you can play the game.' The [current collection on Polygon](https://opensea.io/collection/age-of-rust ) now has 3 new assets and re-imagined art compared to the [older collection](https://opensea.io/collection/age-of-rust-curated) on Counterparty.

Timeline Project: **Monaparty**

Significance: [Monaparty](https://twitter.com/MonapartyXMP) was launched on top of [Monacoin](https://monacoin.org/), which was considered Japan's first cryptocurrency. It is modeled from the Counterparty protocol and is similar to 2014 Dogecoin token asset platform [Dogeparty](https://dogeparty.net/). Monacoin is a Proof-of-Work Blockchain that operates off of the Lyra2RE(v2) algorithm with a 1.5 Minute Block Time and a reward of 12.5 MONA. This platform is considered historical in the Counterparty Community as it was one of the first to use Counterparty's open source code to create an entirely separate platform. [This platform](https://github.com/monacoinproject/monacoin) allows the Monaparty community to issue unique tokens inclusive of Art, Music, Trading Cards, Community Tokens, Unlock Tokens, and much more.

Timeline Asset/Project: **MCDUMPING**

Significance: The [Oasis Mining](http://kasaneate.starfree.jp/om/) project on the Counterparty protocol was a spin off an earlier project known as [Memory Chain](https://rarejapanesenfts.com/collection/memorychain/). It featured many artists from Memory Chain as well as significant Japanese cryptocurrency culture at the time. It is also noted on the [rarejapanesenft's website](https://rarejapanesenfts.com/collection/oasis-mining/) that the project 'gave even more freedom of expression to artists'. The first card in the collection , [MCDUMPING](https://xchain.io/asset/MCDUMPING), was created by [水瀬 亞里亞](https://rarejapanesenfts.com/artist/%e6%b0%b4%e7%80%ac-%e4%ba%9e%e9%87%8c%e4%ba%9e/) (Maria Minase) and depicts a time period in 2017 when the price of Bitcoin decreased very rapidly.

Timeline Asset/Project: **COVALC**

Significance: Despite the Counterparty community being so intertwined with [Emblem Vault](https://emblem.finance/) in the modern day, [this project](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1652345.msg16601030#msg16601030), which looked to 'combine different blockchain wallets into a single tradable NFT token' was started many years before on the Counterparty protocol. Their token, [COVAL](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/circuits-of-value/) was traded on Bittrex and experienced many times of high volume trading and interest. The historical token here to look at on Counterparty is specifically [COVALC](https://xchain.io/asset/COVALC). When XCP and similar projects were delisted off the major exchanges during 2017-2018, this project was exchangeless for 6-18 months and then re-emerged on the ETH blockchain using smart contracts to wrap XCP tokens (and many other chains) into a single 'vault' to store digital assets. This project is now centerfold and a staple in the ecosystem with users exchanging not only historical XCP assets, but many types of tokens across many different blockchains.

Timeline Asset/Project: **BITCORN**

Significance: [BITCORN](https://xchain.io/asset/BITCORN) is an asset and in-game currency tied to the blockchain based game called '[Bitcorns](https://bitcorns.com/rules)'. This project borrows elements of its game play from idle games, like [AdVenture Capitalist](https://www.hyperhippo.ca/adventure-capitalist), board games like [Monopoly](https://www.hasbro.com/en-us/brands/monopoly) and [Risk](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/risk/), and app games, like [Farmville](https://www.facebook.com/FarmVille/), but [combines them](https://medium.com/@droplister/how-counterparty-xcp-works-a5d81256de5c) on the blockchain using the Counterparty Protocol. The first asset's in the Bitcorns project, [HELIPAD](https://xchain.io/asset/HELIPAD), [YACHTDOCK](https://xchain.io/asset/YACHTDOCK) and [LAMBOGARAGE](https://xchain.io/asset/LAMBOGARAGE) were released as a 'trio drop'. This project also invited any artist to create their own asset to be included in the project, which would ultimately be included in the game mechanics as well if accepted. The project required a burn of 1000 BITCORN to submit. Another asset worth mentioning is the final asset of the project, which is [BRAGGING](https://xchain.io/asset/BRAGGING) and was a 1/1 'Non-Fungible Token' distributed as a prize at the end of the project to the largest holder of BITCORN.

The artist, Scrilla made 1000 total of CANTSMOKEBTC and anyone who shared the song or video of [CANT SMOKE A BITCOIN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPimmS0TyPs) on Twitter or Instagram, Scrilla sent them a CANTSMOKEBTC as proof that they participated. He ended up burning 900+, which was the unused remainder, but about 60 people participated at the time. His theory was that this token was a proof of concept that people would participate in an artists success (social media promotion) and get rewarded a time stamped proof that they did in fact do so. Scrilla mentioned, "I ran an ad campaign on Twitter for $50 at same time to compare how the two different strategies would work - I ended up getting a significant amount more of traction from the token share and it cost almost 10x less... with the exception of paying $5 or so to send out the 60ish tokens." It gained enough traction that Art Rozenbaum, a writer for bitsonline, [wrote an article about it](https://web.archive.org/web/20221205050154/https://bitsonline.com/dj-crilla-tokens-promote-music-video/). It was also instructed to the users to use the hashtag #CANTSMOKEBTC which is still very visible and searchable [on twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CANTSMOKEBTC) to this day. This song was also one of the first to be promoted on all the possible blockchain solutions, which at the time included: Ujo, Counterparty, SuperRare and ERC-888.

Date: **Apr 6, 2018**

Timeline Asset/Project: **MAFIACASH**

Significance: [Mafia Wars](https://mafiawars.io/) is a decentralized blockchain based mafia themed idle game of accumulation which utilizes the Counterparty platform. The only objective of the game is to accumulate the [MAFIACASH](https://xchain.io/asset/MAFIACASH) reward token. MAFIACASH is distributed each month to players proportional to their share of total Mafia Wars family tokens and their families in-game performance.

Date: **Jun 9, 2018**

Timeline Asset/Project: **LATOMOH**

Significance: The [AtOMo collection](https://blockchainizator.com/atomo-collectibles-list/) started with the 118 elements of the periodic table, each element containing 3 images as animations, with embossed/3D items, and with Creative Commons licensing visually shown on each asset. This project seeks to use a 'blockchainized' version of the Periodic Table of Elements and experiment with their functions. Only half of the 'elements planned supply' were minted on Counterparty. The supply per element was calculated from the physical availability on earth and in the universe: from Hydrogen ([LATOMOH](https://xchain.io/asset/LATOMOH), the 1st one minted) with a locked maximum mint on Counterparty of 2112, to the minimum mint of 256 for the asset [LATOMOSE](https://xchain.io/asset/LATOMOSE) which represents the element 'Selenium'. The second aspect of this project are tokens created with words from the elements by using the [AtOMo speller](https://blockchainizator.com/atomospeller/) such as the assets: LATOMONOICO, FRENSINPARIS. Some of these elemental tokens are apart of other collections too, such as: KEROTIC, KOKO.ATOMO, SHITCOINS.AtOMo, LATOMOFAKE and even ones with pixel design incorporated like: CORNATOMO, SCANATOMO, BTCPAPERSCAN, and PEPEATOMO.

Date: **Oct 17, 2018**

Timeline Asset/Project: **NPCS**

Significance: This is possibly the first [artistic collection](https://wojak7.wixsite.com/npcs) on Counterparty that used the 'subasset' feature as a curated way to incorporate artist submissions. The main theme of the pieces incorporated the 'Non Player Character' meme, though each asset in the series also represented a real Twitter profile as well. For example the first subasset in the series, [NPCS.npc4815162342](https://xchain.io/asset/NPCS.npc4815162342) had a Twitter handle "@npc4815162342". Though unfortunately, almost all profiles in this collection were censored from the Twitter platform.

Date: **Mar 23, 2020**

Timeline Asset/Project: **A11136359864833872787**

Significance: [This numeric asset](https://xchain.io/asset/A11136359864833872787) was a token Scrilla gave away to people who pre ordered the album: [Sound Money](https://rarescrilla.bandcamp.com/album/sound-money). As was the case with the GORILLAGLUE token, this was integrated into [the album's bandcamp page](https://rarescrilla.bandcamp.com/album/sound-money). Only two users total claimed this token within the pre-order window from the redeemable token key. Scrilla also held on to two units of this token and saved one for the artist ankhlejohn who was featured on the single cover art. The cover art was also minted to the description using the JSON format at the time of issuance. Scrilla mentioned he was "was trying to get people a free 'proof of early support' token that showed they were early in supporting the album."

Date: **Mar 6, 2021**

Timeline Asset/Project: **SATOSHINFT**

Significance: This is the first time on the Counterparty Protocol that a named asset was locked at 0.00000001 tokens total. This is the smallest unit possible that a divisible asset can theoretically be on Counterparty. Since it is also the same decimal place as the smallest unit Bitcoin can be (called a 'satoshi'), it was named [SATOSHINFT](https://xchain.io/asset/SATOSHINFT) because it is truly the most 'Non-Fungible' a divisible asset can be. The description includes a reference to an artwork of Satoshi Nakamoto holding a bitcoin and the description read "First single satoshi NFT".

Timeline Asset/Project: **BITCORN.GLASSES**

Significance: In the past, the only way to truly "destroy" a Counterparty asset's supply was to send it to a valid bitcoin burn address. After the token 'destroy' function was added to the Counterparty protocol, [BITCORN.GLASSES](https://xchain.io/asset/BITCORN.GLASSES) was the first token destruction done historically. A total of 470 tokens were destroyed with a memo stating: *Supply Capped*. At this time of writing, only 30 tokens remain of the BITCORN.GLASSES subasset.

Date: **Sep 21, 2021**

Timeline Asset/Project: **BADBURGERDAY**

Significane: On August 31st of 2021, Counterparty developer, Jdog, stated publicly he had encountered an error on his counterparty-server that read ""counterpartylib.lib.check.SanityError: 1984 VOATBURGER issued ≠ 1963 VOATBURGER held". The devs and a few other people running nodes noticed the issue and found it to be that someone "tried to open a dispenser on an empty address real quick in 2 transactions mined in the same block". This someone was a user by the name of 'halluciphile' while he was opening a dispenser for the asset [VOATBURGER](https://xchain.io/asset/VOATBURGER). Jdog released a [hotfix for the issue](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterparty-lib/commit/94fbac7d9c44d0fb97bf481e37d6522e80b03071) and explained this error was a "sanity error" and a fix to "add code to only allow refills from source address" was added to the Counterparty protocol. Another user in the community by the name of 'Indelible' noticed this and messaged halluciphile that he wanted to "tap your shoulder in case any cool stuff was going on". Indelible then realized this situation was very similar to the story of [BADHAIRDAY](https://xchain.io/asset/BADHAIRDAY) and minted art to represent the situation titled: [BADBURGERDAY](https://xchain.io/asset/BADBURGERDAY), which eventually become an official card of the [Fake Rare Directory](https://fakeraredirectory.com/).

Date: **Sep 23, 2021**

Timeline Asset/Project: **FAKEASF**

Significance: This is the official token to enter a submission into the Fake Rares project. The requirements for this project is to burn a single [FAKEASF](https://xchain.io/asset/FAKEASF) card after you have successfully been accepted into the directory. The [Fake Rares](https://fakeraredirectory.com/) project was started to continue on the legacy of the Rare Pepe Project and invite new artists to engage in a similar curating process as was done with Rare Pepes. This project was originally started by Scrilla, artist of DJPEPE. It has since become a thriving ecosystem of artists, collectors and enthusiasts who are interested in bitcoin-native NFTs and have a deep appreciation for this homage to [Rare Pepe](http://rarepepedirectory.com/). Since its inception the project has also opened a 'Fake Rare Commons' collection that requires the Rare Pepe asset PEPECASH to be burned for submission. This project also invites certain members who hold the FAKETORCH asset to bring in rejected assets that were once submitted to the original Rare Pepe Collection to be included in Series 0 of Fake Rares.

Timeline Asset/Project: **TAKANEZUKAMI**

Significance: This experimental project called '[Badger Capsule](https://rarejapanesenfts.com/ja/collection/badger-capsule-ja/)' by [Koji Higashi](https://twitter.com/Coin_and_Peace) begins with this asset named [TAKANEZUKAMI](https://xchain.io/asset/TAKANEZUKAMI) which was designed and minted by [tomotomo9696](https://rarejapanesenfts.com/ja/artist/tomotomo9696-ja/). What is interesting about this series is that the tokens in this series are minted on four separate blockchains including: Counterparty, Monaparty, Ethereum and Polygon. When Koji [announced this project](https://spotlight.soy/detail?article_id=pe2uvwh2c), he mentioned that the art for each card was meant to create NFT's related to the 'names and featured scenes [from] past Bitcoiner reflection meetings'. External artists were invited to engage in these Bitcoiner reflection meetings and go on to create art and submit according to the project's supply and minting rules. Another aspect of this project is that the hired creators in these meetings were also gifted tokens that were issued in the series. Koji went on to explain his theories for minting on multiple blockchains that include: 'expanding [the] reachable user base, providing creators with platform selection strategy, increasing long-term survival probability of platform-dependent series and suppressing buy-out behavior'.

Date: **Sep 28, 2021**

Timeline Asset/Project: **CCSATOSHI**

Significance: This was the first token to use base64 specifically in the description of the asset to represent an image on the Counterparty Protocol. In "description vs. broadcast theory" [this transaction](https://xchain.io/tx/1711458) could be considered the first 'stamp' on Counterparty, though the Stamps project that exists today has different requirements than what was done here. Another interesting thing to note about this token is [this transaction](https://mempool.space/tx/4c19b8f1b4dcefa27490d2a8d4b5afea2350d0b75640e402519e8aa2a628397a) to publish the description (and base64 code) in which the transaction was also intermingled at the time with a multi-sig output on a dispense for some divisible units of SATOSHICARD. The art along with the token was designed in MS Paint and was originally intended for the Bitcorns project as a card submission. [Cornholio](https://twitter.com/C0rnh0li0) mentioned, "It was a test transaction for [CRYPTOCORNS](https://xchain.io/asset/CRYPTOCORNS), where I was creating 100 little cryptopunk style images within a card". CRYPTOCORNS would eventually become a card in the [Barnyard Club](https://barnyard.club/). The subsequent 99 images were also eventually minted using [Ordinals](https://github.com/ordinals/ord), in which Cornholio mentioned trying to hit the ordinal number 69420, but 'missed'.

Timeline Asset/Project: **KEKLUMINATI**

Significance: This project, titled [Dank Rares](https://www.dankdirectory.io/) (or Dank Directory) was started by a [Rare Pepe](http://rarepepedirectory.com/) artist by the name of Boost. The Dank Directory adopted a similar submission and curation process as Rare Pepe and Fake Rares, but used a central currency called DANKMEMECASH to be burned for each submission. The [KEKLUMINATI](https://xchain.io/asset/KEKLUMINATI) card mentioned here is the first card in the entire directory and holds great significance to the project and its internal rules.

Timeline Asset/Project: **SATOSHIDICE**

Significance: This token ([SATOSHIDICE](https://xchain.io/asset/SATOSHIDICE)), minted by [Doggfather](https://twitter.com/DoggfatherCrew), is a very unique and interesting interpretation of 'misprints' or 'failed mints' on the Counterparty platform. The origin of the SATOSHIDICE token comes from [Counterparty transaction 1952](https://xchain.io/tx/1952) in which a user tried to mint a Counterparty token but did not have the 0.5 XCP fee to mint a named token. Doggfather noticed many of these failed issuances were simply not issued again in the future, the oldest one being specifically Counterparty transaction 1927: [PPCOIN](https://xchain.io/tx/1927). SATOSHIDICE is specifically the second 'failed mint' on the Counterparty protocol but is the first 're-minted' failed mint on the Counterparty platform as Doggfather technically sucessfully minted SATOSHIDICE first in Counterparty transaction 1822063 (which is almost seven years later). Doggfather has an [in-depth medium article](https://doggfather.medium.com/chasing-invisible-2014-counterparty-tokens-e0916c96c60f) going over the whole story and the cultural significance of what [Satoshi Dice](https://satoshidice.com/) was (a very early blockchain-based lottery game) and what SATOSHIDICE is as a token.

Timeline Asset/Project: **PHOCKHEADS**

Significance: [PHOCKHEADS](https://xchain.io/asset/PHOCKHEADS), Series 0, started as a Bitcoin parody of Namecoin’s BLOCKHEADS. The interesting thing about [the project](https://phockheads.com/about/) is that PHOCKHEADS began regularly utilizing Counteparty’s dividends feature to distribute subassets to holders of the grail card which is the PHOCKHEADS token. With Series 2, PHOCKHEADS evolved to be community-run, composed of multiple grail cards by top Counterparty artists.

The Bassmint collection was created to "to disrupt the music industry to give ownership and power back to the artist by removing the greedy business middle man companies."

Significance: This asset, [A7337447728884561000](https://www.rarestamp.xyz/stamp/A7337447728884561000), is the first stamp in the [Bitcoin Stamps](https://github.com/mikeinspace/stamps/blob/main/BitcoinStamps.md) project originally theorized by [MikeinSpace](https://twitter.com/mikeinspace) and implemented by [Kevin](https://twitter.com/reinamora_137) and [Arwyn](https://twitter.com/mrarwyn). It was inspired by the creation of [Ordinals](https://github.com/ordinals/ord) that it was possible to create "on-chain" art by leveraging Counterparty based on the bare-multisig quirk that bypasses OP_RETURN. This stamp in particular in considered quite simple and experimental compared to the art that would be developed in later stamps. Since the size of the image is limited to 24x24 pixels, most of the stamps are considered true 'pixel' art.
