        "Significance": "This protocol change looks to eliminate the XCP fee associated with creating a subasset. Since many of early arguments for having an XCP on named asset creation was centered on an 'anti-squatting' mechanism, the community argues that this is not needed for subasset registrations since the creator already owns the main named asset used. This update also pairs well with the introduction of subasset creation with numeric tokens as well as the Glyphs proposal by MikeInSpace.",

While this is already possible with named assets and is somewhat of a simple upgrade, this proposal also includes documentation for using this new functionality for 'Glyphs'. Issuing subassets on Numerics, MikeInSpace proposes, incorporates a new token 'meta-protocol' that can introduce a 'runes-like' functionality with subassets on numerics. This means these numeric subassets 'can be leveraged to create a Runes-like, but better, tokenization standard'. This proposal brings together the Fair Mint proposal, Elimination of Fees on Subassets and this much simpler Subassets on Numerics porposal to introduce an new contemporary token standard using Counterparty.",

Also, as mentioned on the Counterpary website 'When you use Counterwallet, all transactions are signed on your device and your private keys are never stored on our servers. All information sent to our servers is encrypted by your Counterwallet client for maximum security, and every trace of your session is erased when you log out. All you need is your passphrase for easy and secure access.' This wallet was working and live up until January 14, 2024 when the servers hosting this wallet were taken down due to an issue with a new protocol update. While a few types of fixes were proposed at the time, the current lead developer (Adam Krellenstein) has stated that he will not be working to bring this wallet back online, nor update it to the more recent features offered with the Counterparty protocol.

    "Significance": "This wallet, built by EverdreamSoft in collaboration with IndieSqaure, was one of the most popular mobile Counterparty wallets of its time. Book of Orbs offered client-side encryption and decentralized trading using the Counterparty DEx. This wallet supported an organized and collection specific trading interface of the most popular Counterparty projects such as Spells of Genesis, Age of Chains, Force of Will, DieCast, Sarutobi, Bitgirls, Memory Chain, Rare Pepe, Oasis Mining, Age of Rust, SKARA the blade remains, Gamicon, CrystalsCraft, At O Mo, Mafia Wars, Bitcorn Crops and more. This wallet application referred to assets/tokens/cards on Counterparty as 'Orbs' and many users in the community mention the Book of Orbs interface as their favorite user interface designs overall to trade Counterparty assets. The acronym 'ORB' stands for 'Ownership Recorded on Blockchain' and refers to a system that includes assets, tokens, and governance rules related to the management of fungible, semi-fungible, non-fungible, fractionalized, and wrapped tokens. In essence, ORB is similar to the more commonly known NFT, or non-fungible token, but encompasses a broader range of Assets and tokens that are managed on a blockchain. Sadly this wallet was discontinued and the EverdreamSoft team mentioned in a Medium article that 'its dependencies on third-party services made it very difficult to maintain the application up to date and working correctly.' The team goes on to invite users to use the new EverdreamSoft wallet 'Casa Tookan' or Freewallet to continue using Counterparty functionality into the future.",

The original purpose for developing Freewallet, as mentioned in his ZeroG interview, was to create a wallet he could use personally to do Counterparty actions that are accepted by the protocol, but were not offered by Counterwallet for regular users at that time. This wallet is now the most up-to-date and most commonly used wallet in the Counterparty community due to the Freewallet Desktop version offering all Counterparty functionality allowed on the protocol such as: client-side authentication and encryption, sending and receiving Bitcoin/XCP and all Counterparty assets, creating and managing tokens and token ownership, distributing dividends, broadcasting data using Counterparty broadcasts, signing messages and transactions, using the Counterparty Decentralized exchange for all asset types, an integrated exchange interface for the Counterparty DEx and Dispensers (including dispenser watchlists), multiple addresses support (including Segwit addresses), add-on password functionality, QR codes for public addresses, Counterwallet and BIP-39 seed types, reset token divisibility status, support of the BTCpay mechanisms for trading against BTC pairs on Counterparty, the Multi-send functionality and much more. Freewallet Mobile version is avaliable on the App Store (for Mac) and Google Play Store (for Android) and many users start with the mobile wallet, but this mobile version has not been updated since March 15, 2019 and does not include a vast majority of Counterparty features. So it is recommended to use the standalone Desktop version as it is updated and maintained more regularly. The Freewallet.io website also includes a community created User Manual (written by davesta) and a community supported Telegram chat for users to ask questions regarding Freewallet functionality. Since the underlying code was and has always been public, new developers such as Noop have used the base functionality/code of Freewallet to develop NinjaWallet later in time. It is also highly recommended to verify that you as a user are downloading the correct wallet from Freewallet.io as other wallets (that do not support Counterparty) have a similar name but are not at all connected to this Counterparty specific wallet.",

The new version of this wallet also supports ease of use on a mobile device, minting tokens within the wallet using the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), and even was used in the Fest Rares collection to give users an in-person free mint pass to create custom pepe art. Traders using this wallet can use simple Bitcoin functionality, card for card trading using the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange, as well as buying and selling assets using PEPECASH/XCP (which was the most common way to trade Rare Pepe's in 2016-2019). This wallet is also very known for labeling all 'non-RarePepe' assets as 'Fake Rares' as was a cultural custom in the Rare Pepe community, though access to all types of Counterparty tokens owned is supported within the user interface. This wallet also historically had a 'gift-card' feature to easily gift new users a card by redeeming a one-time-use code. These codes were also commonly hidden within Rare Pepe submission art as well as image metadata.

This wallet was also historically used in the Sarutobi game as well as the Takara project, but was discontinued in late 2019.

Since the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange had become popular at this time, this cryptographic layer aimed to re-create the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange while also going through a private process of regulatory compliance. In a Coindesk article Byrne said, '[Counterparty] is true to the ethics of bitcoin, true to the open-source nature, they're true to the principles.' While this venture was closed in April of 2021, Overstock stated in the press release, 'We remain bullish on blockchain technology and are excited for Medici Ventures to enter this new post-closing phase' and also go on to mention they would be shifting focus to their 'core e-commerce business'.",

Levine, Andreas Antonopoulos, and Stephanie Murphy are the most well-known contributors at Let’s Talk Bitcoin, but the network was comprised of a multitude of freelance (autonomous) editors, contributors, and sponsors, plus their rapidly growing audience. The idea behind LTBcoin was to generate a finite number of coins and then distribute those coins over a five year period based on a pre-defined distribution protocol. In this manner, contributors, members of the audience, and every other stakeholder can earn LTBcoins while maintaining a vested interest in the overall health of the network. LTBcoins were earned by producing or consuming content on the website and used as currency to buy items such as merchandise and advertising on podcasts. LTBCOIN was also listed on major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges at the time, including Bittrex and Poloniex. It may be considered one of the first 'altcoins' made on the Counterparty Platform and is one of the more documented projects from the early days of Counterparty. While the original website still holds a good deal of historic content, the best place to learn about this era is by listening to the original Let's Talk Bitcoin Show (now called 'Speaking of Bitcoin'). Other great overviews of this era with Adam B. Levine can found on the first episode of Art on the Blockchain, The Adam McBride Show, and The Charlie Shrem Show.",

        "Event": "TATIANACOIN",
        "Significance": "Tatiana Moroz, a graduate of Berklee College of Music, has been a vocal advocate in the Bitcoin community since 2012. She was a part of the community in the 'Let's Talk Bitcoin' podcast and was helped by Adam Levine to create a Counterparty token that represented crowdfunding for her music. A popular service used now that is analogous to this blockchain structure would be a centralized service like Patreon. TATIANACOIN is considered 'the first musical artist coin and the alpha for the concept of artist tokens'. Owning this coin meant you were funding the recording of Tatiana’s 'Keep The Faith' album. The first TATIANACOIN logo was designed by Everyday Earth, but the eventual album cover is made from an original signed artwork by Ross Ulbricht drawn for Tatiana. He gave it to her as a birthday gift after Tatiana visited Ross in prison. Tatiana has been a long time vocal advocate for not only Ross but Bitcoin in general and was one of the first individuals to visit him from the Bitcoin community. As mentioned on her website, 'From as early as 2015, Tatiana had conceived of a token that would contain her combined music and artwork. She minted a run of 100 tokens for this purpose in 2015. Then in 2017, she minted tokens to contain all her albums to date.' These include the TATIANAMOROZ (100 coins), minted Oct 10, 2015 and the TATIANAALBUM (900 coins), minted on Feb 10, 2017, among others.' The original distribution of this token was done through her website and used the 'CoinPowers' software to launch bidding for the token on a daily basis. The less bids that were in on that day, the more tokens were given to the bidders. Tatiana would also be referenced later in a Spells of Genesis card designed around her story and musical background named: TATIANACARD. This token and subsequent music and album tokens after sparked an interest and importance for artist freedom and selling uncensorable tokens. To find out more about Tatiana's music, TATIANACOIN and other initiatives check out her interviews on Exploring the Vintage NFT Space with ZeroG, The Adam McBride Show, Art On the Blockchain with Scrilla and HODLCast with Sasha Hodder.",

        "Significance": "OLGA was the first asset to be truly 'Non Fungible' using Counterparty as it is a 1/1 piece that is not divisible into smaller units. This asset also contained significant intention and meaning. OLGA was used as a gesture of love whereby JP Janssen dedicated a token to his sweetheart ‘Olga’ with the additional text stating ‘My Eternal One & Only'. It is also the first Token to include a non-English language as well as non-ASCII characters. Approximately a year later (August 2015) he added a message (using the Broadcast function) to the metadata in base64 format which contained an image of a light pencil drawing of them kissing. This is considered one of the first assets with a text description, and with the metadata added in August of 2015, OLGA is also considered the first 'Image Embedded NFT' on the Counterparty protocol. JP also added a message along with the image which translates to: 'My dear eternal Olga! Congratulations on your birthday!'. The theory behind using these functions and formats was so the data would be saved 'on-chain' and accessible without any exterior links, and of course, to express that there is only one OLGA.

        "Significance": "JPGOLD is the first token created by JP Janssen.  At a protocol level this was the first locked supply token that had a low issuance at the time of minting. Though in contemporary times, minting 1000 of a token might not seem limited, at the time it very much was. As described by JPJA on his website: 'Although Counterparty was already half a year old and 1147 assets had been issued so far, none had a low, locked supply. None were even close. The lowest by then was 100,000 tokens – one hundred times more!' He goes on to say, 'you may find collectibles with earlier initial issuance. But all of these have had some economic parameters changed later, meaning been locked and/or had tokens destroyed.' An interesting fact about this token is the embedded pdf file minted alongside this token. JPJA mentioned on his website, 'On the day of issuing JPGOLD I wrote a short notice in my blog. A few months later, in October 2014, I copied the blog into a pdf, and then embedded the file’s checksum in a bitcoin transaction.' Yet another usage case for this token was the Dividend option JPJA was given when minting this token. Within the image embedded publicly on the Bitcoin blockchain was a motive for collectors. JPJA writes in the pdf, 'just for fun I minted my own coin', 'it can be transferred as easily as Bitcoin', 'it is better than Bitcoin in one aspect', 'I can chose to pay every holder of JPGOLD a dividend'.

At the time Sebuh used this locked, non-divisible asset and sold them for 0.144 BTC in which you could redeem the SEBUH tokens for a RBox Rockminer through his website.

        "Significance": "Each unit of this unique Counterparty token, named BEEP, was made to be a token that could always be redeemed for a unique sound. This token was minted by Theo Goodman and the original directions to redeem your 'unique sound' was to send the BEEP to a specific address, in which you would receive an 'echo'. In the original bitcoin talk forum post the directions gave an example transaction which contained a sample transaction for the echo effect to show interested users. The user was then to take the base64 included in that echo and play the file in a program that converted that specific information into a unique sound. This is a very interesting and early use of 'token controlled access' while also integrating a unique base64 code on-chain for the 'echo' of this BEEP token. It definitely was a unique chord struck in Counterparty asset history and one of the first to use base64 and musical integration on the Counterparty platform. To learn more about Theo Goodman, check out his interview with ZeroG, his Art on the Blockchain interview, and his interview on the Unconfirmed Transactions podcast.",

It could also be used by customers to pay for usage of the distributed storage network. Unfortunately, when the BTC mining fees became very high at one point around 2017, it became very expensive to send payouts to thousands of node operators every month so the project leaders decided to migrate the token to Ethereum which at the time had low gas fees. Storj still openly thanks the Counterparty community for being there for their idea when it was originally established. This asset also historically became one of the 12 cryptocurrencies officially approved of by the Japanese government in 2017 and was also used for 'token controlled access' to a section on the Let's Talk Bitcoin website.",

The tokens FFLTEAMA through FFLTEAMN represent an individual Fantasy Football Team (A through N) which you could bet on and possibly receive a return on. Though that was only true if the team did well enough that season. The return on investment was through the LTBCOIN token. Adam Terwilliger wrote in this Let's Talk Bitcoin article about the experience of owning a team in this fashion: 'I have also given someone, who knows very little about fantasy sports, the ability to invest in an experienced fantasy sports competitor. They can check out my profile, look at my body of work, and ultimately decide my worth to their investment.' Check out the results of that specific season here.",

This was one of the first use cases for a physical object connected to a Counterparty token.

        "Significance": "Artist, Nili Lerner, released in September of 2014 a very early and historical 'NILIcoins' project which included tokens to represent proportional ownership of her artwork. The project consisted of 11 tokens: 7 brandname tokens referencing popart, 3 social art tokens and 1 NILI representing ownership of physical art. She mentioned, 'The tokens were also made to illustrated different future monetary models yet were created as the art objects itself'. She also stated on the debut Bitcointalk post that NILIcoins were created to 'promote a competitive credit-provides ecosystem'. Nili went on to explain on her Twitter that these tokens 'are created and sold as crypto art objects, not a as a financial asset. 80% of most tokens will not be available to own privately (only as holding and as part of a DAO).'

They created a project code-named Medici, which was a 'front-end and portal to the decentralized stock exchange of the Counterparty platform'. Since the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange had become popular at this time, this cryptographic layer aimed to re-create the DEx while also going through a private process of regulatory compliance. In this Coindesk article Byrne said, '[Counterparty] is true to the ethics of bitcoin, true to the open-source nature, they're true to the principles.' While this venture was closed in April of 2021, Overstock stated in the press release, 'We remain bullish on blockchain technology and are excited for Medici Ventures to enter this new post-closing phase' and also go on to mention they would be shifting focus to their 'core e-commerce business'.",

        "Significance": "Inspired by the Let's Talk Bitcoin project (and LTBCOIN), Koji Higashi issued CNPCOIN in November of 2014 to help promote his personal Bitcoin blog. The description of the coin states, 'Currency for Coin and Peace blog', but the early usage and distribution of this token even caught the eye of a CoinDesk journalist. Koji offered shares of this token to any individual who retweeted his articles at that time period. Koji mentiones, 'Say I write an article, update my blog and tweet about it. If someone retweets it I follow up and say, 'You retweeted my article – if you can create a Counterparty wallet and tell me your address, I can give you X amount of my coin'. After this initial CNPCOIN distribution, Koji would later add token-gated access to some articles in the blog. This is a great blockchain example of 'Premium' content to token holders. Corin Faife, in his Coindesk Article, writes: 'CNPCoin started to take on a demonstrable value as an access token, which let Higashi move into the next phase: setting up a system where readers could tip him in bitcoin if they enjoyed his blog posts – and receive CNPCoin in exchange.' In the article, Koji even mentions his suprise at the success of CNPCOIN saying, 'It started off as a pure experiment, just to see what would happen, but I actually got quite a lot of tips from it.' CNPCOIN would also go on to influence the art and purpose of the Spells of Genesis card CNPCARD. This Spells of Genesis card commemorating Koji (CNPCARD) would eventually be used by Christian Moss in the Sarutobi game for in-game upgrades and would be apart of the cross-functionality of SOG and Sarutobi. This token (CNPCOIN) is now considered one of the pioneer tokens for representing written articles independently within Counterparty tokens and could possibly be 'the earliest token on blockchain [that was issued] in Japan'.  To learn more about Koji and how CNPCARD was used in Sarutobi check out the recorded twitter space with Shaban, Christian Moss and Koji published on The Adam McBride Show.",

From the initial supply of 100,000,000 units, 30% were kept by EverdreamSoft, the token issuer, and the remaining 70% were offered on sale during the “BitCrystals Token Sale”. As stated on the official website 'BitCrystals (BCY) is the official currency of Crystal Suite. They are distributed for users’ engagement in the Crystal Suite products, but also in partners’ games.' This asset's supply would eventually be partially burned and released on the ERC-20 contract on Ethereum as well. The company stated they did this 'in order to adapt the coin to our current multi-chain product strategy.' This asset also historically became one of the 12 cryptocurrencies officially approved of by the Japanese government in 2017. At the end of each month, the equivalent of 50% of the cards and in-game sales income in BCY is burnt. BITCRYSTALS would become the centerpiece currency for almost all interactions with Spells of Genesis. To learn more about Spells of Genesis, check out Shaban Shaame's interview with Adam McBride, Shaban's interview with ZeroG, The Birth of the Metaverse interview with Adam McBride, Nicolas Sierro's interview with ZeroG, and a joint recorded twitter space with Shaban, Christian Moss and Koji Higashi.

The digital image was published openly for download but the Counterparty asset associated and the physical that went with it were sold for $50 (plus shipping) per individual piece at the time.

        "Event": "FDCARD",
        "Significance": "Arguably the historical holy grail of tokenized assets within the Counterparty community. It is the oldest digital game collectable ever tokenized to Counterparty. FDCARD was originally exclusively distributed to participants of the innovative FoldingCoin project as a reward for contributing their idle computational power. This original distribution of FDCARD could be considered a partnership with FoldingCoin. FDCARD was also released to give players a blockchain backed asset for the trading card game Moonga by Everdreamsoft. As stated in a release by Everdreamsoft 'we have successfully connected Moonga to the blockchain and will be introducing a series of special blockchain-based trading cards for Moonga and our upcoming game Spells of Genesis. The first among these is the FDCARD.' FDCARD is card #1 within the Spells of Genesis game which was the first game to leverage blockchain for in game assets (aside from currency purposes). The FDCARD is also one of the first instances of tokenized cryptoart, especially in a curated collection. The artist of FDCARD was Alejandro Hurtado, but other artists contributed to the art in the project such as Ryo Feugere, Andrew Fairhurst, Ramsès Melèndez and Herckeim. Many of the pieces in the collection reference cryptocurrency culture at the time of minting. The company EverdreamSoft, founded by Shaban Shaame, leveraged the Counterparty platform to tokenize a series of assets on the bitcoin blockchain for use in their game Spells of Genesis which still remains active today. It should also be noted here that while FDCARD is the oldest of the 'birth of the metaverse' assets, it was not the first Counterparty asset to be included in a live game (see SATOSHICARD, CNPCARD and SARUTOBICARD). The FDCARD is now a highly sought after collectible and regarded as a historical artifact that pioneered the emergence of an entirely new asset class. To learn more about FDCARD and Spells of Genesis, check out Shaban Shaame's interview with Adam McBride, Shaban's interview with ZeroG, The Birth of the Metaverse interview with Adam McBride, Nicolas Sierro's interview with ZeroG, and a joint recorded twitter space with Shaban, Christian Moss and Koji Higashi.",

Owning a BLACKBOX token or its subasset derivitaves shows user participation in the project and support for the community.

        "Event": "SATOSHICARD",
        "Significance": "Through a collaboration between Spells of Genesis and SaruTobi, the SATOSHICARD is recognized as the oldest tokenized metaverse asset on the Counterparty Protocol. SATOSHICARD was integrated into both of the two blockchain games by two different developers, providing different utility in each. The first game with use for SATOSHICARD was not Spells of Genesis initially, but the Sarutobi game by Christian Moss. A great article by IndieSquare Wallet is linked to get a good overview of how owning this Spells of Genesis asset gave players extra features in Sarutobi. On May 18, 2016, Christian implemented this blockchain functionality by making the Spells of Genesis assets CNPCARD, SARUTOBICARD and SHUMAICARD playable in Sarutobi. These three assets would eventually mark the first instance of Counterparty tokenized assets becoming included in a mobile game, though SATOSHICARD (the oldest of all the tokens included) and CNPCARD ownership also offered incentives in the game. It should be noted here that the functionality of the Spells of Genesis cards (and CNPCARD) was added to Sarutobi before the official Spells of Genesis game was released on April 20th, 2017. To which it should not be understated that the SATOSHICARD would play a rare and integral part in the Spells of Genesis game as well. To learn more about SATOSHICARD and Spells of Genesis, check out Shaban Shaame's interview with Adam McBride, Shaban's interview with ZeroG, The Birth of the Metaverse interview with Adam McBride, Nicolas Sierro's interview with ZeroG, and a joint recorded twitter space with Shaban, Christian Moss and Koji Higashi.

        "Significance": "This token, named SALVATION, was the first time Token Ownership Rights for a named asset was transferred to a burn address. The minter, JPJA, also explains on his website a deeper story and involves much more meaning than just a 'burned Ownership rights' token. The token was an early test of a very limited issuance. It was also announced on Reddit through an anonymous profile, was mentioned on a Robert Ross podcast, and was almost traded 1 to 1 for an FDCARD using the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange. Unlike A714159941780378900, the Token Ownership Rights were transferred and not the total supply. This, in effect was the first use of 'locking the description and locking any subasset's to be issued' while keeping the total supply liquid to buy/sell or move around. The Token Ownership Rights for SALVATION was sent to the vanity burn address: 1SaLvationGodsMarveLousGracaLgYQS. It was minted with the description stating 'SAVE UR SOUL FROM SIN & ITS CONSEQUENCES'. The artwork, which represents Paul the Apostle, was added later in 2017 and is from the public domain.

The first three cards in the series: GENET, GRAYWOLF and LOCHNESS all have sha256 hashes of the card images broadcast with a truncated base64 representation of the data from the minting address. JP also went on to do this process for the first 26 Spells of Genesis cards after. He states on his website 'Of course, this was unofficial. I was not associated with Spells of Genesis. But I did create cryptographic proofs of the designs existing at the time, and I did show which images I, as a fan, considered to represent those tokens.' On his website JP also explains and teaches you how to verify the images with the on-chain information in the broadcasts. This collection came out of a project called 'XCP CARDS' in which JP stated, 'An essential part of the project was to notarize all cards, meaning engraving hash proofs inside Bitcoin transactions'.

        "Event": "SARUTOBICARD",
        "Significance": "A young iOS developer in Australia by the name of Christian Moss released a game on the App Store called SaruTobi where players tapped the screen to spin a monkey to see how far they could get him to fly. This game was historic not only because it was the first mobile app to offer users who played a bitcoin prize in satoshis, but historic as well by eventually including Counterparty assets as well. Christian wanted to let SaruTobi players purchase in-game items with Bitcoin but Apple’s iOS App Store terms didn't allow it. Instead he let players collect small amounts of Bitcoin as they played. At the time, Christian was working with IndieSquare on wallet implementation and helping with the development of Book of Orbs. On May 18, 2016, Christian implemented this blockchain functionality by making the Spells of Genesis assets CNPCARD, SARUTOBICARD and SHUMAICARD playable in Sarutobi. These  three assets would eventually mark the first instance of Counterparty tokenized assets becoming included in a mobile game, though SATOSHICARD and CNPCARD ownership also offered incentives in the game. It should be noted here that the functionality of the Spells of Genesis cards (and CNPCARD) was added to Sarutobi before the official Spells of Genesis game was released on April 20th, 2017. SARUTOBICARD in this circumstance would be singled out to be a cultural and tokenized representation of SaruTobi's influence on Spells of Genesis and cryptocurrency culture in general at the time. Christian even mentions in his interview with ZeroG that employees at Coinbase were playing Sarutobi. This card would also be incorporated into a separate game called SaruTobi's Island which allowed players to use proof of ownership of Counterparty assets to generate playable characters in SaruTobi's Island. Christian noted about the developing decision, 'Koji mentioned a japanese game called Monster Farmer, where you could generate monsters by putting any CD in your game system', which inspired Christian to 'give some utility to any token a user may have'. These events would put SARUTOBICARD into three separate blockchain games (Spells of Genesis, Sarutobi and Sarutobi's Island) and could be considered the most 'included metaverse Counterparty asset' of its time. To learn more about SARUTOBICARD, check out Episode 23 of Art on the Blockchain, Christians interview on The Adam McBride Show, Christians interview with ZeroG, The Birth of the Metaverse with Adam McBride and a recorded twitter conversation with Christian, Shaban Shaame of Spells of Genesis and Koji.",

The process included buying and owning one of the tokens mentioned above to access Adam's album and recieve unique perks for each token. At the time the cost of the album was either $5 in bitcoin, $7 with credit/debit, $2.50 worth of LTBCOIN and a couple other payment options. It was an early use of 'token controlled access' that allowed token holders to prove they held the token to access the music.

        "Event": "NINJASUIT",
        "Significance": "NINJASUIT is the first Counterparty asset specifically native to the game SaruTobi (created by Christian Moss) and would eventually be realized as the first NFT gaming 'skin', one of the first 'NFT power-ups' and also marked one of the first instances of an NFT being used in a play-to-earn mobile game. While SATOSHICARD, SARUTOBICARD and others were already used in the Sarutobi game by this time, those assets were originally intended for use with Spells of Genesis. NINJASUIT particularly was native only to Sarutobi and was the first to offer not only a cosmetic addition for the user, but also a significant powerup to be used in the game. The power-up involved a double-jump where the in game character, 'instead of falling will jump mid-air giving you another chance'. Since the game centered around the longest distance the character could travel, this was a huge addition for players to have to progress their scores even higher. Gaming 'skins' have been around since RuneScape, Team Fortress 2 and Counter Strike. Many parents also know they are commonly bought for games like Fortnite, but these developers do not always set a fixed immutable supply nor limit continued distribution of these digital assets. What makes NINJASUIT so historic is the fact it is (and was) backed by a locked, immutable and very rare token supply on Counterparty. This token could be traded at any time using the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange, giving users an opportunity to not only instantly collect this gaming skin, but also sell it later and possibly for a decent profit. All within the IndieSquare Wallet that Sarutobi linked to!

        "Event": "Takara",
        "Significance": "Takara was launched in the summer of 2016 and was Bitcoin's first ever 'geocatching App'. It used the Counterparty Protocol and the IndieSquare API to 'drop' Counterparty user created tokens and Bitcoin anywhere in the world. This means if a user went to the location the asset was dropped, they could 'find' the asset and it would be delivered to their Counterparty address. This app was very popular and had many downloads on IOS as well as Android and at its peak it included assets from many Counterparty projects including Spells of Genesis, Rare Pepe and many others. This app was even used by the popular Japanese exchange Zaif to drop company related tokens for curious and interested users of Takara. A great anecdote about this app is the story of how a user dropped the legendary RAREPEPE asset for Christian Moss to pick up in Tokyo, but Shaban Shaame (of Spells of Genesis) and Koji Higashi (of IndieSquare Wallet) simply happened to be there first to 'pick it up' with the Takara app. After some deliberations, Koji mentioned to Shaban he could go ahead and pick up as it was slightly out of the way from their travels at the time. Something he (and Christian) mention later as 'quite a big mistake' to miss the opportunity to pick up this asset up at the time. To learn more about Takara, Christian Moss, IndieSquare, Koji, Zaif and this missed RAREPEPE opportunity, check out The Birth of the Metaverse with Adam McBride and a recorded twitter space with Christian, Shaban and Koji on The Adam McBride show.",

In August of 2016, FoW combined IndieSquare’s Counterparty API services with EverdreamSoft’s dashboard for game management and asset registration. FoW utilized blockchain game items and planted the seed for a generation of games and applications with interoperable assets and items. Eiji Shishido, CEO of Force of Will, explained the decision to use Counterparty protocol stating, 'The borderless nature of blockchain technology inspired us. FoW is not an online game currently but we wanted to bring in a new value to the game industry. We wanted to offer FoW players a whole new experience and the new value proposition based on the cutting edge technology.' Force of Will released their cards as tokenized assets along with a currency ‘WILLCOIN’ on bitcoin via Counterparty. It had been intended that a game would be launched in which the assets could be used, however the game never eventuated.",

        "Event": "RAREPEPE",
        "Significance": "Looking through a historical lens, RAREPEPE is considered an integral part of the birth of the global cryptoart movement as it is the first project on Counterparty to invite any artist from anywhere in the world to participate. The project centers around a central theme of an internet meme called 'Pepe' that was originally a character in a comic titled 'Boy's Club' by Matt Furie. Some of the initial posts about this project came from the Bitcointalk forums. Series 1, Card 1 of The Rare Pepe Directory is titled 'RAREPEPE' and was minted by a user named 'Mike' with the description stating: 'The most rare pepe that has ever existed'. In the early days, the cards from this project were primarily traded on the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange directly for PEPECASH, XCP and even card for card orders. This primary currency (PEPECASH) not only was supported by centralized exchanges like Tux Exchange and Zaif, but was one of 12 cryptocurrencies officially approved by Japanese Government in 2017. PEPECASH was originally distributed to holders of RAREPEPE, GOXPEPE, and SHITCOINCARD. A portion of PEPECASH was also donated to FoldingCoin miners. After some giveaways on Twitter and in the Rare Pepe Telegram chat, the rest was burned, which ended up being about 300 Million units. A burn or 'destruction' of 2100 PEPECASH was required at the time of approval for each artwork submission in the directory. The option to buy, sell and trade pepe cards were offered in the Book of Orbs wallet alongside projects of the time like Spells of Genesis, Bitgirls and many others. Rare Pepe even had a project specific wallet called The Rare Pepe Wallet developed by Joe Looney. There is a significant amount of culture, Counterparty firsts and deep lore from this project Many artists featured in the directory are still very active in the cryptocurrency community to this day. The project was closed in February of 2018 ending with 1774 different distinct pieces of art regarded as 'The Rare Pepe Directory'. Many include references to cryptocurrency culture, internet culture and pop culture, political memes, art history and one of a kind artworks. This was somewhat also the case as per the art in Spells of Genesis, but this time from many different worldwide artists. Many projects emulating this 'open arms artist invitation' have been created since including, but not limited to: 'Fake Rares' and 'Dank Rares'. While there is reference to 'Pepe' in a previous token description named CLIO, RAREPEPE was the first to include Pepe artwork represented by a Counterparty token and definitely wasn't the last to do so.",

        "Event": "PEPECASH",
        "Significance": "Early on, in the first series of the Rare Pepe Directory, it was theorized to have a project centered currency to trade against all the cards from all the artists in the directory. Since many tokens were already being sold against XCP and since the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange supported 'asset-for-asset' trading pairs, PEPECASH became the currency of exchange for trading Rare Pepe's in the community. It was also a card in the directory itself with minted art by Mike. PEPECASH was originally distributed to holders of RAREPEPE, GOXPEPE, AND SHITCOINCARD. A portion of PEPECASH was also donated to FoldingCoin miners. After some giveaways on Twitter and in the Rare Pepe Telegram chat, the rest was burned, which ended up being about 300 Million units. This card was also used to submit cards into the directory from that point on, though you were required to send it to a specific burn address to do so. These trading theories were done because this project predates the 'destroy' function as well as the 'dispenser' function. This asset also historically became one of the 12 cryptocurrencies officially approved of by the Japanese government in 2017. It is not uncommon for more recent projects to still use PEPECASH, for instance the Fake Rares 'Commons' section requires a 'destruction' of PEPECASH for submission.",

The first of which was to include a curated music playlist of original music written by Scrilla that could be listened to as 'token access controlled'. When a user proved they owned this specific Rare Pepe card in their RarePepeWallet they could access the content. This included a playlist of original music by Scrilla, which would change periodically over time, and even include pre-releases of songs before the general public had heard them. Within Joe Looney's RarePepeWallet, this feature was included as a 'Bonus Content' button in which you could access this content when you owned the DJPEPE token. When DJPEPE was accepted into the Rare Pepe Collection, it was the first to begin experimenting with attached content. Other tokens like PEPENATION for example, even though earlier in the series, added content at a later date. DJPEPE specifically is considered the first 'audio-visual' tokenized asset on Counterparty because of the relation to the easily unlockable content and it's accompanying art in Rare Pepe, though it went on to do much more. DJPEPE has had its own twitter account since 2017, has attended rare cryptocurrency events, has its own brand, has a variety of subassets created from the original token for various purposes, has live 'DJ'd' events and has become a major meme personality within itself. Learn more about DJPEPE on his Youtube account here. To learn more about Scrilla and his other works on Counterparty, check out his interviews on HODLCast with Sasha Hodder, his interview on the Unconfirmed Transactions podcast, his interview with ZeroG, and the podcast he hosted named: Art on the Blockchain.",

Villar wrote on the card itself 'It looks and acts like a game, but it isn't a game, it's just a tech demo'. While other Counterparty tokens linked to outside games (such as FDCARD, NINJASUIT and SARUTOBICARD), PEPEBALT stands out in this circumstance as an early asset with 'token controlled access' to the game itself.

It was the first Counterparty musical token to directly represent a physical album purchase and was also used it as a proof of concept to pitch to bandcamp on the idea of integrating tokens with their platform. After little response from bandcamp, Scrilla eventually even minted the email sends and responses to the SuperRare platform.

        "Significance": "In 2016 and 2017 there was a Japanese TV Show that aired in Tokyo and the surrounding area (14.3 million households) featuring Japanese women known as ‘BitGirls’. Episodes aired on a weekly basis, and participants could use Torekabu-nushi (Trading-share-card holders) to cast votes after each episode. The voting included having the girls wear different costumes and change standing positions during each show. Each girl’s performance on TV would affect her popularity, thus increasing or decreasing the value of her token, and influencing viewers’ trading behaviors. Investors could then trade the BitGirls on the Zaif exchange and tokens for each individual 'BitGirl' could be traded on the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange for assets like XCP. This early innovative approach was effectively one of the earliest forms of ICOs or 'governance tokens' before a name had been given to that approach. To learn a little bit more about BitGirls, Zaif and how Counterparty fit in to all of this, check out The Birth of the Metaverse with Adam McBride and a recorded twitter space with Christian Moss, Shaban Shaame and Koji Higashi on The Adam McBride Show.",

The company was founded in 1988 as a family business and then bought out by Collectable Brands in 2017. The interesting history behind this one is that EverdreamSoft (Spells of Genesis) and Collectable DieCast shared an office building during this early innovation period. After coming to understand each other’s business, it was agreed that an attempt would be made to transition the interest of collectors from the traditional physical medium to the digital realm by tokenizing their goods on the BTC blockchain via Counterparty. In order to draw attention to these assets and reward users, EverdreamSoft partnered with Christian Moss and coordinated an innovative distribution of some of these assets in connection with a geocaching app called Takara. The unusual method of distribution and innovation forged new ground in this new space of ‘air-dropping’ digital assets. The earliest minted token of this project is BPOLOSOMCXVI but the entire set features 18 one of kind tokens with 18 one of a kind cars that represent them.",

Bitcointalk forum poster 'xnova' stated in this post that the more technical explanation of this issue was: 'the parameters chosen for a HAIRPEPE order hit up on an obscure bug where the calculated integer value chosen for the order quantity was higher than the max integer value for sqllite, but equal to the max int value used in the python validation code (they differed by 1). Thus, the value was not further limited in the sanity check code, and when the daemon was attempting to store the record in sqllite it caused an exception.' The user, novax, went on to say that because of this mishap 'we now handle this situation in a way that should avoid this kind of issue in the future anywhere in the code.'

Lead innovator Koji Higashi has recently written an article and developed an explorer providing some amazing insight into this early project and others.",

        "Event": "RUSTBITS",
        "Significance": "The Age of Rust video game is a 'thrilling single-player sci-fi adventure filled with danger and intrigue' and was originally intended to use Counterparty assets for features to be unlocked in the game. The Counterparty token RUSTBITS was used within the game itself 'to unlock abilities, secret areas, and crypto rewards for players'. Proving ownership of not only RUSTBITS, but other cards like ROGUEMECH (the oldest in the series of 7 separate cards) gave the player unique 'token accessed' content within the game. While the tokens were originally minted on the Counterparty platform, during a period of very large transaction fees on Bitcoin, the team decided to use Enjin and eventually the Polygon platform to distribute and entangle the token ownership with the game. Age of Rust published a beta playtest on the Steam platform but it was removed in October of 2021. On their website, the team mentioned that 'Steam decided to remove Age of Rust from the Steam platfrom because NFTs can be sold for real-world currency off their platform. [Steam] has also updated their terms to block blockchain and NFTs from using the platform.' At the moment, it looks like the game will be released again on the Epic Games platform soon and will only be avaliable to play if a user proves they own a specific 'Privateer NFT' (which is yet to be minted and distributed). The team mentioned that 'there is no need to purchase the game separately, as long as you have a Privateer NFT, you can play the game.' The current collection on Polygon now has 3 new assets and re-imagined art compared to the older collection on Counterparty.",

When XCP and similar projects were delisted off the major exchanges during 2017-2018, this project was exchangeless for 6-18 months and then re-emerged on the ETH blockchain using smart contracts to wrap XCP tokens (and many other chains) into a single 'vault' to store digital assets. This project is now centerfold and a staple in the ecosystem with users exchanging not only historical XCP assets, but many types of tokens across many different blockchains. To learn more about the story and background of COVALC, check out the Shannon Code interview on The Adam McBride Show.",

He ended up burning 900+, which was the unused remainder, but about 60 people participated at the time. His theory was that this token was a proof of concept that people would participate in an artists success (social media promotion) and get rewarded a time stamped proof that they did in fact do so. Scrilla mentioned, 'I ran an ad campaign on Twitter for $50 at same time to compare how the two different strategies would work - I ended up getting a significant amount more of traction from the token share and it cost almost 10x less... with the exception of paying $5 or so to send out the 60ish tokens.' It gained enough traction that Art Rozenbaum, a writer for bitsonline, wrote an article about it. It was also instructed to the users to use the hashtag #CANTSMOKEBTC which is still very visible and searchable on twitter to this day. This song was also one of the first to be promoted on all the possible blockchain solutions, which at the time included: Ujo, Counterparty, SuperRare and ERC-888.",

The minimum issuance was 256 total tokens for more rare elements such as Selenium (LATOMOSE). The second aspect of this project are tokens created with words from the elements by using the AtOMo speller such as the assets: LATOMONOICO and FRENSINPARIS. Some of these elemental tokens are apart of other collections too, such as: KEROTIC, KOKO.ATOMO, SHITCOINS.AtOMo, LATOMOFAKE and even ones with pixel design incorporated like: CORNATOMO, SCANATOMO, BTCPAPERSCAN, and PEPEATOMO.

This project was originally started by Scrilla, artist of DJPEPE. It should also be noted that the 'Fake Rare' Series 0 collection includes tokens that were originally rejected by the Rare Pepe directory years before and also includes historically significant tokens like GORILLAGLUE. This project also invites certain members who hold the FAKETORCH asset to bring in rejected assets that were once submitted to the original Rare Pepe Collection to be included in Series 0 of Fake Rares. The Fake Rares community has since become a thriving ecosystem of well-known artists, collectors and enthusiasts who are interested in bitcoin-native NFTs and have a deep appreciation for this homage to Rare Pepe. There are also many hidden possible 'firsts' in the directory such as augmented reality tokens, full musical albums, on-chain artwork and much more. Since its inception the project has also opened a sub-collection 'Fake Rare Commons' collection that requires the Rare Pepe asset PEPECASH to be burned for submission.

What is interesting about this series is that the tokens in this series are minted on four separate blockchains including: Counterparty, Monaparty, Ethereum and Polygon. When Koji announced this project, he mentioned that the art for each card was meant to create NFT's related to the 'names and featured name scenes in the video of past Bitcoiner reflection meetings'. External artists were invited to engage in these Bitcoiner reflection meetings and go on to create art and submit according to the project's supply and minting rules. Another aspect of this project is that the hired creators in these meetings were also gifted tokens that were issued in the series. Koji went on to explain his theories for minting on multiple blockchains that include: 'expanding [the] reachable user base, providing creators with platform selection strategy, increasing long-term survival probability of platform-dependent series and suppressing buy-out behavior'.",

In 'description vs. broadcast theory' this transaction could be considered the first 'stamp' on Counterparty, though the Stamps project that exists today has different requirements than what was done here. Another interesting thing to note about this token is this transaction to publish the description (and base64 code) in which the transaction was also intermingled at the time with a multi-sig output on a dispense for some divisible units of SATOSHICARD. The art along with the token was designed in MS Paint and was originally intended for the Bitcorns project as a card submission. Cornholio mentioned, 'It was a test transaction for CRYPTOCORNS, where I was creating 100 little cryptopunk style images within a card'. CRYPTOCORNS would eventually become a card in the Barnyard Club. The subsequent 99 images were also eventually minted using Ordinals, in which Cornholio mentioned trying to hit the ordinal number 69420, but 'missed'.",

Doggfather noticed many of these failed issuances were simply not issued again in the future, the oldest one being specifically Counterparty transaction 1927: PPCOIN. SATOSHIDICE is specifically the second 'failed mint' on the Counterparty protocol but is the earliest 're-minted' failed mint on the Counterparty platform as Doggfather technically sucessfully minted SATOSHIDICE first in Counterparty transaction 1822063 (which is almost seven years later).

This stamp in particular in considered quite simple and experimental compared to the art that would be developed in later stamps. Since the size of the image is limited to 24x24 pixels, most of the stamps are considered true 'pixel' art, though many later stamps would include art that was much more technical, of greater definition and even in .gif format. When looking through a historical lens at the first stamp that was issued, a plethora of tokens and projects have started since using the STAMP format. So many projects that including them all would cause this timeline to be quite bulky after this date.

    "Significance": "The Drooling Ape Bus Club is a series of open-submission art pieces that make fun of the well known Ethereum project 'Bored Ape Yacht Club'. The project was started by Brad Mills somewhat by a single idea in a tweet posted November 20, 2021. Brad was upset and annoyed from all of the celebrity interest and fake popularity spike of the Bored Apes, calling them 'sham jpgs' and invited any artist to create memes to make fun of them. He offered to pay 10 million satoshis per art piece sent to him that made fun of Bored Apes. Brad explains he was angry that people like Jason A. Williams, who is a very Bitcoin centered voice in the community, hopped on board to the Bored Apes hype. Eventually Jason was convinced and hopped onto the 'Drooling Apes Trolling' going on to tweet something very similar to Brad offering to pay per art piece sent to him. This tweet by Jason influenced a very large twitter audience and this new interest and satoshi reward incentive not only inspired many indiviudals to create 'Drooling Apes', but would be eventually include influence by Aryan Jabbari to create a Telegram group to record all the art and start a Counterparty community. Aryan Jabbari also began the work to start Counterparty collection/website and MikeInSpace would also be involved as a curator of the project. Later in time, Joe Looney and Aryan would be accepted on as curators for DABC. This happened in a very quick fashion after the twitter hype, to which Brad was frustrated and said 'these are not NFT's, they are JPGs'. He originally thought it was hypocritical to start an NFT project with art making fun of an NFT project, but the artists and admins eventually kicked Brad out because he was against the idea of minting these pieces or even calling them NFTs. The project is currently up to series 6 and is still accepting submissions at this time, though few spots remain. The submission rules as written require the art to be square, a non-divisible asset with at least 69 tokens issued and mentions 'the drawing should be original, not just a copy of a Bored Ape'. Most submissions, many by existing Counterparty artists, mock Bored Apes using grotesque, raunchy or ridiculous meme trolling and generally reference Counterparty culture as well. Though even with these requirements, some submissions use GIF's and are not limited to just square images as is in the Bored Ape collection. Many of the tokens also simply include an 'imgur' image link in the description, something that was common with submissions in the Rare Pepe Collection during 2016 and further exemplify the 'JPG' nature of tokenized artwork.",

    "Event": "Fake Commons",
    "Significance": "The Fake Commons Directory is a sub-collection of the Fake Rare Directory that involves destroying PEPECASH (a card/currency from Rare Pepe) to submit artwork. In a quick manner, the token used for Fake Rare submissions, FAKEASF, became very coveted and rapidly expensive for artists to submit to the directory. Since PEPECASH was burned by the artist for accepted submissions in the historical Rare Pepe project, the expansion into Fake Commons adopted this method. This opened up many new artworks from existing Counterparty artists and openly invited all artists to submit because the process was much cheaper and had much less strict curation from the Fake Rare 'scientists'. At this time there are over 51 separate series of Fake Commons with wildly ranging themes, references to pepe the frog, political and cryptocurrency history, popular meme culture, and many hidden artistic gems. Series 8, also called the Fake Commons Gallery Edition, stands out historically because the pieces included either had accompanying physical artwork shown in NYC during a 2022 event, or were given away to attendees using an in person Pepe themed ATM machine. Some series in the collection have themes such as KEKMAS and Pepertoy (series 47 and 48). Others have connections to in-person events such as Pepes in Paris (Series 44) and Bali Edition (Series 51). It is remarkable that at this time the main Fake Rares collection have already reached a significant milestone of the time-span of submissions being active. But it is also historic that the Fake Commons collection has surpassed the time span for accepting submissions for a longer time period than the original Rare Pepe project did. Submissions for Fake Commons and Fake Rares are still open at the time of this writing.",

    "Significance": "Fake Munchkin is a directory that invited artists to create custom art for trading cards in relation to a popular tabletop trading card game by Steve Jackson called 'Munchkin'. The submission process involved creating a Counterparty token and corresponding art that used templates for five different types of cards in the game: RACE, CLASS, CURSE, MONSTER or an ITEM card. At this time a total of 24 cards are accepted into the directory, with the community card FAKETREASURE being the first in the series. Much of the accepted submissions incorporate the Fake Rare style of pepe art with the intention of being actively used in a Series 1 mini-game sometime in the future. Many of the rejected cards from this collection would eventually be their own series in the Phunchkins project and many of the artists in both were active in the Fake Rare/Counterparty community at the time. It is unclear whether submissions are still open or if the Series 1 mini-game ever came into fruition.",

    "Event": "FAUX SOGS",
    "Significance": "Faux Sogs is an open invitation card directory created by Coinking and Cornholio for creating fake 'or faux' Spells of Genesis art. Artists are invited to continue on the legacy, memetics, art style and history of SOG by using the trading card style template and fantasy inspired characters from Spells of Genesis. For example, the first card in the collection, IRLFDCARD, is directly inspired by the FDCARD token. Coinking mentioned about the collection, 'I see fauxs as an extension of SOG. It followed a similar fasion in which we received submissions and curated the collection based on what was happening at the time (both in crypto and real world) but it certainly took the seriousness off of SOGs and sprinkled lots of degeneracy you'd see from [Rare Pepes].' The structure of the series has an interesting 'chase card' mechanism where the idea is to collect at least 11 or more other cards in the current series of 20 to have the privilege to create the final and 21st card in the series. FAUXDINGCARD was the first chase card and was a collaborative effort of over 50 different artists that added to the image one after the other. The gif attached to the asset shows the progression of this process. The chase card for every series after series 1 tends to be rarer, not only by design but also with issuance (as the normal minimum for issuance is 50 total tokens per card). Sometimes the chase card is earned by artists who had a stand out card in the series and personally collected the most from the other artists in that same series. Other times it is a collector who has collected at least 11/20 of the total current series submissions. In this specific case the collector works with the curators to commission the next chase card artwork. Herckeim, the artist of the original Spells of Genesis token SATOSHICARD, is the artist for the STSHRDX Faux Sogs submission. Herckeim was also comissioned to design an art piece to comemmorate Series 1 of Faux Sogs which is a subasset of the FAUXSOGS token (FAUXSOGS.21.SERIES1) which is not apart of the collection itself. There are a few pieces like FAUXSOGS.21.SERIES1 that are linked to Faux Sogs, but not included in the collection, such as 'FAUXDINGCARD.unfolding'. Many exisiting Counterparty artists and developers were involved in this project, such as Joe Looney, Cornholio, tomopen, MikeInSpace, Shaban Shaame, JPegKillah and many others. There are currently 13 total series of 21 separate Faux Sogs tokens per series by many well-known Counterparty artists. Submissions are still open at this time.",

    "Event": "FootballCoin",
    "Significance": "This innovative project, FootballCoin, originally looked to use Counterparty Tokens to give a user the chance to building a fantasy soccer team. This process included choosing real world professional players from the different leagues listed in the game, choosing formation types, relying on their real world performance to gain points, and picking players specifically backed by digital tokens in the fantasy game. Originally in 2017 the coin XFCCOIN was minted to serve as the intermediary exchange token between the subsequent 469 separate soccer players (represented with individual tokens) that users could choose to add to their team. Many of the tokens varied in issuance between 1500-5000 total token units and the XFCCOIN could be exchanged into XCP and eventually directly into Bitcoin. As described in the FootballCoin whitepaper, 'in 2018 we launched our very own blockchain' and rewarded existing holders with a '3:1 conversion of XFCCOIN from Counterparty to the new blockchain'. Since then, many new players and tokens have been created on the new XFCCOIN platform, but the originial Counterparty tokens still show as the building blocks and genesis of FootballCoin. The FootballCoin fantasy football game is still live at the time of this writing and their website includes in depth tutorials on their website on how to navigate the fanstasy FootballCoin user interface.",

    "Event": "Modern Relics",
    "Significance": "Modern Relics is a collection of historic tokens minted Dogeparty in 2014 and Counterparty in 2015 created by Ernest and Jdog. Since both of those protocols do not allow multiple token names with the same characters, many of the early tokens were simply people reserving common names for resell value in the future. Modern Relics strove to bring new life to those early mints that commonly had little or no extra information attached to them. On their website they state, 'this project aims to breathe new life into this collection of ancient tokens by making them more appealing and tradeable, with desirable characteristics'. The distribution process for this project revolves around the COLLECTOR token (two separate tokens, one on Dogeparty and one on Counterparty). If a collector holds COLLECTOR they automatically recieve one airdrop of a monthly modern relic. These relics are early minted names like 'GREED' or 'CRAB' but Modern Relics provides a way for artists to submit art that will be added to the descriptions of these old tokens. The distribution schedule of the drops, which started in May of 2023 and continues to this day, is shown on the Modern Relics website. If an artist submission wins, they recieve 25 out of the 100 supply of these old token relics, the rest are distributed to COLLECTOR holders. According to the website, even rejected submissions will 'have the artwork minted as a custom sub-asset [of the relic token]. The artist will [also] be given full ownership of their sub-asset with the ability to issue supply, lock, etc.' The artwork submission fee for Modern Relics and their 'sister project' Rude Relics is a token named RELICSUBMIT that has a current supply of about 997 tokens. During the initial months of this project much of the trading and exchanging of relics used the RELICASH coin in a similar manner to the way Rare Pepe used PEPECASH to exchange value. This included trading cards that were outside of this collection for RELICASH, with the hope to acquire rarer relics.",

This extends Counterparty functionality to not just publishing the data of the token with Counterpary, but also extends the functionality of an Ordinal Inscription by creating a bigger issuance of the token issuance. On their website the project states the purpose is to 'represent the next logical mechanism for artists to create and share their work. Using a combination of immutable, cryptographically unbreakable protocols, artists now have the ability to preserve their work eternally on the Bitcoin blockchain.' What is highly interesting about this project is that the submission theory turns a 1/1 non-fungible Ordinal token into a 1/1 fungible (divisible) Counterparty token that can be split into 0.00000001 individual units. This project, similar to Rare Pepe and Fake Commons, requires the PEPECASH token to be burned to be accepted into this collection.

This term, which is a Telegram slang term for people creating new accounts and posing as different users, makes fun of any users or scammers lurking under different names in the Counterparty community. As stated on the website, 'many Rare Socks are a twist on some classic Rare/Dank/Fake Pepe's' but 'with an original sockystyle twist'. To submit to the directory, which is currently on series 5 at this time, a user must have their submission accepted and burn a token called SOCKSCAMCASH. This directory hopes to bring 'awareness that some Telegram users are willing to go to any extreme and create hundreds of sock accounts for bad intentions'. Submissions are still open at this time.",

At the moment there are 2 series of 92 separate accepted pieces, the first of which was focused on games and the second based on movies. Much of the art is by well known Counterparty artists and adds a 'retro flavor to Counterparty mascots/memes' while involving some of the most legendary and respected video game culture icons from the 80's and 90's. Compared to other Counterparty collections and directories, RetroXCP does not require the burning of any other assets for a user's submission to be accepted into the directory.

The requirements of the submissions is that all pieces in the collection 'must be scannable using a phone camera'. While there is 'no limit to the number of QR codes you can use' in the artwork, there is strict guidelines for image dimensions and size. There are also strict guidelines for what the QR code can link the user to, such as not using link shortener services nor forwarding to NSFW content. There are also different collection genres a user can form their art towards such as famous artists, charity, music, geography and others. Some of the collections have been locked and cannot be submitted to and others are still open for submissions at this time. Each closed and 'locked' collection involves anywhere from 8-18 pieces, is composed of many existing Counterparty artists and contains wildly eclectic ways to creatively present a QR code. Many of the pieces go to great artistic length to reference worldwide art history, memetic culture, Counterparty culture, and highly intricate uses of moving images (gifs) while still being scannable by a standard phone camera.

This proposal, titled 'File Storage in P2WSH Outputs', was not named 'OLGA Stamps' until about 2 months after the CIP and minter tool was published by JPJA. Since this process involved a cheaper and more efficient way to create Counterparty Stamps, the Stamps community including MikeInSpace, gave it that name later commemorating JPJA's past minting of the OLGA NFT token in 2014. After this uptick in interest and popularity for CIP 33, JPJA announced this OLGA Stamps competition to invite artists to try this new process out. The rules involved minting in this new manner between Bitcoin block 833,000 and 834,000, minting a token supply between 1-1000, and including a design directly inspired by the original OLGA artwork. What is very interesting about this process is that JPJA included a custom tool to mint these tokens manually using the Electrum wallet (an older and very technical Bitcoin wallet). JPJA also offered a reward (PEPOLGA) for first place and the Dogeparty mint of OLGA for 'all high-effort contributions'. His original twitter thread is a great place to view all the submissions for this contest.",

During these minting times at the events listed above, all individuals interested were given a free mint pass (that covered the BTC and XCP costs for minting an asset) and a print-out template to draw their Fest Rare Pepe submission. This process also invited new users to use Joe's new mobile friendly version of Rare Pepe Wallet (rarepepewallet.wtf) to mint the pieces with a one-click, easy to upload, IPFS system for attaching art to Counterparty tokens. There are no requirements for token divisibility, token issuance and no requirements to burn tokens to be accepted into the collection. You simply had to be there (or following along with the live feeds) for a chance to be included in the Fest Rares collection. The website that shows off all these submissions was a community made venture by archivist.eth (@punk3606 on Twitter) and Subterranean to document all the cards submitted and organize them by series.",

    "Event": "Early AI Art",
    "Significance": "While the line between programmed, generative or 'Artificial Intelligence' art is somewhat blurred and hard to distiguish in artistic pieces, it is known that very early AI pieces were published using Counterparty tokens. Since Rare Pepe was a project that invited any artist from around the world to participate, many new styles of artworks appeared in 2016-2017 and this is where much of the early AI art emerges. The oldest AI artwork on Counterparty (that we know of) is a Rare Pepe token by Mr. BitcoinBeast called PEPEME which used a website AI tool called 'deepart io'. Despite PEPEME having the oldest minting date, other pieces like PEPEALIEN by CryptoChainer, SCORPEPE, KEKSBASILISK by Katie Charm, NEUROPEPE by Alex Green, KEKTOPUS by Meme Conscious, CUBISTPEPE by Looks Rare, NAHUAL by Duncan and quite a few others have been found to use AI or AI programs. These include Deep Dream, Prism, Piscart AI or a mix between a few separate programs. This topic seems very contemporary and many questions and debates have arisen over which programs were used to create the art, what type of programming style or AI type was used in that tool, whether or not the art was copied from an earlier artist and what even constitutes as an AI tool at all. It comes as no suprise individuals now and into the future will wonder about the crossover into AI art becoming commonplace and it is evident Counterparty tokens were a part of that crossover period, but it is still unclear regarding 'which was first'.",

    "Significance": "Within a prior protocol called Namecoin, Monegraphs (Monetized Graphics) were among the first blockchain collectibles with artwork and the intention of digital ownership. These assets became very popular when Sotheby's auctioned off the first piece in Monegraphs by Kevin McCoy, 'Quantum', for $1.4 million dollars. While eighteen of these tokens were created using Namecoin, two of them by Joe Hamilton were minted using Counterparty. The first of which is a named asset called MGAAAAAAAAAAA that included a Vimeo file link, a sha256 hash, a Twitter link, ownership of the artwork and a JSON as the description. The video file included with this asset is an avante-garde video piece titled 'Regular Division'. While MGAAAAAAAAAAA is a non-divisible asset with a current supply of 1, the token issuance is not locked at this time. The second asset, A1028163271339900500, is a numeric divisible asset minted in March of 2015 that also has remained unlocked for issuance at the time of this writing. This other numeric token included much less information than MGAAAAAAAAAAA and simply includes a JSON in the description.

    "Event": "CrystalsCraft",
    "Significance": "CrystalsCraft was a user-generated content collection created by EverdreamSoft (the same developers of Spells of Genesis). This project was similar to Rare Pepe and Memory Chain with its open invitation to all artists to submit artwork, but varied in a few ways. While Rare Pepe gave a 'magic template' for artists to use (or not use) with their submission artwork, CrystalsCraft curators invited users to strictly use a given border design and write a few words about the piece. One of the curators (and Community Manager of EverdreamSoft), Yzia, mentioned 'the idea was to have unity in the collection'. EverdreamSoft even still has the tutorial Youtube video live that went through the entire process of how to create a Book of Orbs/BitCrystals wallet and account to submit artwork. This process also included a non-refundable submission fee payable in 20 Bitcrystals total for any entry with 10,000 token issuances. The fee was slightly higher for artists that wished to mint a smaller supply of tokens (minimum of 200 tokens per art piece). The first card in the series, GDCNOVADEMO was a demo card to show the interested community on how the art would be shown with the CrystalsCraft specific 'trading card' design. A handful of artists participated in this open-invitation project, such as Peter Bock, who seemed to use some sort of AI tool in the MOUNTAINHOME and BUDDHAOFCOIN assets. Because the overall theme was 'Blockchain Allegories', many of these artworks involved deep political, Counterparty and cryptocurrency cultural references such as the Bitcoin block process, EOS, Spells of Genesis/Bitcrystals art, Trump, Kim Jong Un, and even CryptoPunks. Out of the 36 different artworks in this collection, 16 of them were designed by Joe Chiappetta (an artist who has been in the comic book industry for over 3 decades, best known for the 'Silly Daddy' comic series). Out of all the submissions, Joe was very successful when the CrystalsCraft collection was traded with the Book of Orbs wallet. Out of the limited editions of 200 per card, each of Joe's cards sold at least 15 copies and many sold over 50 copies. In a Patreon post, Joe mentioned, 'the Book of Orbs marketplace is available as a phone and tablet app as well as a desktop version [making] it easily accessible to everyone based on personal preference!'. Joe also goes on to thank EverdreamSoft for 'releasing such a fun, user-friendly, and collector-centric marketplace.'",

  "Significance": "In this era, the main way to sell or swap Rare Pepe's was to use the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange and sell for PEPECASH or XCP. At this time two individuals in the Rare Pepe community, Theo Goodman and RarePepeNews, would run separate auction groups and settle manually with both parties after the auction was finished. Theo's auction house is now named 'NFT Auction' (https://t.me/nftauctions), but this historical sale of the PEPEPIZZA 1/1 Rare Pepe NFT for $35,000 (320,000 PEPECASH) was sold specifically in the auction house created by RarePepeNews which is now named WTHAuctionHouse on Telegram (https://t.me/wthauctionhouse). At this time, this was the highest USD value sale of any Rare Pepe or any Counterparty asset in general. The sending transaction to the bidding winner (Katie Charm) is mentioned in the memo of the transaction which states: 'Congratulations Dr. Katie'. To this day, RarePepeNews and Theo still run auctions in the Telegram groups mentioned and many collectors express that these auctions are one of the best places to this day to bid on Rare Pepe and other highly sought-after Counterparty tokens for the cheapest prices.",

    "Significance": "This sale for HOMERPEPE is one of the more well known and well documented sales in Counterparty history. This sale was at the first live in-person digital collectible auction at the Rare Digital Art Festival event in 2018 (also called RAREAF) and the auction was conducted by MemeConscious. Many well known digital collectible pioneers attended, such as Joe Looney (Rare Pepe Wallet), Shaban Shaame (Spells of Genesis), Mack Flavelle (Crypto Kitties), Bea Ramos (Dada), Matt Hall (CryptoPunks), Kieran Farr (Decentraland) and many others. There is still a video record of the last moments of this auction on Isabel Draves's Youtube page. HOMERPEPE was sold for 350,000 PEPECASH to Peter Kell, which at the time was worth $39,200. This was also the highest sale of any cryptocurrency asset/card/token in the entire crypto space (and HOMERPEPE wasn't even called an 'NFT' at the time). What is super interesting about this sale is the Peter Kell and another bidder both walked on stage thinking their highest bid was the winning bid due to confusion and how loud the auction room was. Peter Kell mentions in an interview by 'The Bitcoin Express' that the other bidder and Peter literally flipped a coin for which bidder would win the HOMERPEPE at the RAREAF auction. This coinflip and more details from the event are best described by Daniel Penny of the Paris Review in his article 'How Much for That Pepe? Scenes from the First Rare Digital Art Auction.' After this sale, Peter Kell was also interviewed in the well known Pepe documentary titled 'Feels Good Man' by Arthur Jones.

Another interesting cultural point about this sale is that Yahoo News published an article by Rachel Kraus titled: 'Frightening Pepe/Homer Simpson trading card sells for a ridiculous amount'. The tone in Yahoo media articles about this subject might be due to a different socio-political atmosphere of news organizations around anything 'Pepe' related after the 2016 US presidential election. Despite this press coverage, this sale would add an incredible amount of fuel and credibility to the sale of Counterpary assets and crypto related digital collectibles in general. Just four years later in 2022, Yahoo's publishing tone would change drastically during their coverage of the Natively Digital 1.2: The Collectors' auction from Sotheby's.",

    "SaleAmount": {
      "ETH": 205,
      "USD": 320000
    },
    "Significance": "At the time, this sale was considered the highest USD sale of any cryptocurrency collectible (or NFT) ever to happen in Counterparty history. This sale is directly connected to the HOMERPEPE sale at the Rare Digital Art Festival in January of 2018 where Peter Kell won an auction for HOMERPEPE. This sale is also connected to a Matt Kane SuperRare art piece titled 'CRYPTOART MONETIZATION GENERATION' commemorating the epic HOMERPEPE buy by Kell in 2018. In an interview with ZeroG, Scrilla describes that he happened to be in the comment section of the the piece by Matt on SuperRare and mentioned Peter was open to selling this NFT. The story goes that TokenAngels contacted Scrilla to reach out to Peter Kell and the sale was eventually made over the counter using Joe Looney as a trusted escrow to finalize the swap. Peter expressed how he felt about the decision in an Instagram post shortly after the 205 ETH sale ($320,000 at the time) saying, 'They laughed when I bought HOMERPEPE for $39k... but when I sold it for 205 ETH....' and goes on to say 'this is an absolutely insane event in the NFT world ... More proof that NFTs are the real deal and will be a big part of how art is sold in the future.' This sale is one of the most known RarePepe sales due to its coverage on Coin Telegraph, NewsBTC and many other cryptocurrency news organizations that dove into the story. Peter was also interviewed by a couple well known Youtuber accounts such as The Bitcoin Express and Know Your Meme. These interviews give viewers some backstory on this epic sale decision and further details about the Rare Digital Art Festival and how he originally won the auction for the HOMERPEPE.",

    "Significance": "During the last day of the 'Natively Digital 1.2: The Collectors' auction from Sotheby's, three assets (specifically Rare Pepe assets) were sold in this somewhat new 'Metaverse' style auction from this popular and respected auction house. During this auction, the PEPENOPOULOS card set the record for the highest sale of any Counterparty asset in history. As explained on the official Sotheby's twitter, 'Natively Digital 1.2 is focused on the luminaries and champions of the NFT ecosystem - the collectors themselves - that have shaped the industry through their curation of early stage emerging artists, and culturally significant projects'. This auction showcased 53 digital tokens from 19 different collectors, but out of those, the collector TokenAngels, put up three cards from his Rare Pepe collection. The three included were PEPENOPOULOS, RAREPEPE and PEPEAIR. The RAREPEPE was auctioned for $240,000, PEPEAIR was sold for $52,000 and the PEPENOPOULOS 1/1 NFT was sold for $3,650,000. On October 26, the Sotheby's twitter showed off this record sale and mentioned the 'extremely Rare Pepe', named after Andreas M. Antonopoulos, 'possesses the unique trait of mass education and the results to show for it'. This sale would ignite a renewed interest not only in NFT's but in the historical collections that lived on Counterparty. Many news organizations followed this auction closely, such as Yahoo Finance in an article by Sean Dickens published before the sale when the auction was 'teased' by Sotheby's. This is highly interesting because only a few years prior, Rachel Kraus of Yahoo called these Rare Pepe assets 'frightening' and the prices sold 'ridiculous'. Other outlets would cover this story after the auction ended such as Forkast News, Coin Rivet and many others. While the original auction page on the Sotheby's website seems to be inaccessible even with the Wayback Machine, many screenshots such as one by sant_xyz on twitter, show the details and UI module created by Sotheby's to bid on these historical assets online. To review the entire lot history of these Natively Digital Auctions, Statista has kept the public records of all assets sold in this auction (though the data is behind a paywall to access more lot sales information of this Sotheby's auction event).",

This card also has some deeper backstory to hip-hop history as well as a connection to the cultural significance of owning one million PEPECASH (the main currency used in Rare Pepe). Scrilla explains this influence and story of this card in an interview with ZeroG published September 2, 2022. While another PEPEMILLION was sold for 16 BTC about 6 months later, this sale for 15 BTC was a higher USD equivalent totalling $876,889.

    "Significance": "This is the historical highest sale of any Sarutobi related card on Counterparty. This one is most likely sought after due to its background of being the first 'Gaming Skin NFT'. This sale was done through Emblem Vault, which allows for Counterparty assets to be sold on Ethereum marketplaces like OpenSea. While this sale was done with the Emblem 'Legacy' Vaults, which is an older version of the vault minting process, Emblem still offers this service with a more up-to-date and robust way of authenticating and curating vaults. On January 27, 2022 a single token of this card was sold for 28.888 ETH ($71,093.36 at the time of sale). Looking at the on-chain sales data of NINJASUIT, the original sale of this card in its initial distribution was a USD equivalent of $2.43.",

It is a very early piece in the Rare Pepe collection by DanDarkPill and was originally issued with 2 tokens total (to represent the twins), but later 1 of the tokens was sent to a burn address and is unrecoverable. This dispenser sale was done by the '6529capital collection' for 20.75 BTC with a USD equivalent of $630,904.31 to purchase the remaining last card. Funny enough, this sale was shown off with a video that reads 'How to buy a RARE PEPE from a dispenser?'. This transaction is in the top tier of the highest sales for the Counterparty protocol, especially when looking at data of dispensers of any Rare Pepe. Looking at the on-chain sales data, when this card was originally distributed in 2016, the pair was sold for a USD equivalent of $85.50 for each WINKELPEPE.",
