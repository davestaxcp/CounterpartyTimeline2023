This repository is dedicated to publicly organizing and critiquing a public list for Counterparty’s vast historical tokens, projects, wallets, historical sales, developer updates and forks to the Counterparty Protocol since Counterparty’s inception. 

The Time.Graphics infographic is a visual representation of the data.

The markdown files include the information shown on the Time.Graphics timeline in an easily readable manner. The JSON files include that same information in a more organized way for future use in presenting the data.

## Goal

---

The goal for this data is to eventually include it all into a cool infographic style Historical Timeline to be published on [Counterparty.io](https://counterparty.io/) in a new page titled “History”. 

This timeline idea was originally published in [this Counterparty Forum post](https://forums.counterparty.io/t/updating-information-on-counterparty-io/6669) which was about updating the Counterparty website to include more current information. It was then moved to these two posts: [here](https://forums.counterparty.io/t/counterparty-developer-timeline-for-counterparty-io/6675) and [here](https://forums.counterparty.io/t/counterparty-token-asset-project-timeline-for-counterparty-io/6688), but now finally lives here in this Github repository.

It is my hope that this data below will give more inspirational education to the current and future Counterparty community, as well as give light on historical and groundbreaking projects done in the past using the Counterparty protocol.

Shoutout to Damian at Rarepepes.com for [showcasing the timeline](https://rarepepes.com/timeline-xcp/).

## Notes From the Author

---

This is still a public draft.

The process of gathering blockchain information, organizing the data correctly and getting critiques is still underway.

Since Adam Krellenstein recently archived and paused the CIP process, CIP data from before that date of archival is included in the [CIP list](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/Forum/tree/1e362f7f8668654d0241fe5b1f1c1c330a8b4368).

Proposal data from the community has now been moved to the [Counterparty Github Forums](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/Forum/discussions), or to be found somewhere in the [Milestones](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterparty-core/milestones) section of counterparty-core.

I invite you to verify, critique and fork this information to perfect this list so all can benefit off of the goal of publishing this content on [Counterparty.io](Counterparty.io) and for any educational purposes beyond that.

Feel free to reach out to me on [Telegram](https://t.me/davesta) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davesta_xcp) if you need to request changes to information or would like to contribute to the data included here.
