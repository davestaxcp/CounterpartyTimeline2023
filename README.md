## Goal

---

The goal for this data is to eventually include it all into a cool infographic style Historical Timeline to be published on [Counterparty.io](https://counterparty.io/) in a new page titled “History”. 

This timeline idea was originally published in [this Counterparty Forum post](https://forums.counterparty.io/t/updating-information-on-counterparty-io/6669) which was about updating the Counterparty website to include more current information. It was then moved to these two posts: [here](https://forums.counterparty.io/t/counterparty-developer-timeline-for-counterparty-io/6675) and [here](https://forums.counterparty.io/t/counterparty-token-asset-project-timeline-for-counterparty-io/6688), but now finally lives here in this repo.

It is my hope that this data below will give more inspirational education to the current and future Counterparty community, as well as give light on historical and groundbreaking projects done in the past using the Counterparty protocol.

## Notes From the Author

---

This is still a public draft.

The process of gathering blockchain information, organizing the data correctly and getting critiques is still underway.

Some assets post-2021 have been included, but since so many projects and notable assets have been made since 2021, a significant amount of the recent Counterparty projects have been omitted to focus on the previous historical developments of the older tokens. 

~~Some developer updates that are still underway (or pre-drafted) are yet to be included until they are officially in the~~ [Counterparty CIP list](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/Forum/tree/1e362f7f8668654d0241fe5b1f1c1c330a8b4368). Since Adam Krellenstein recently archived and paused the CIP process, CIP data from before that date of archival is included in the CIP list above and proposal data from the community has now been moved to the [Counterparty Github Forums](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/Forum/discussions).

I invite you to verify, critique and pull request this information to perfect this list so all can benefit off of the goal of publishing this content on [Counterparty.io](Counterparty.io) and for any educational purposes beyond that.

Feel free to reach out to me on [Telegram](https://t.me/davesta) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davesta_xcp) if you need to request changes to information or would like to contribute to the data included here.

## Tokens to be Researched

- include all "green banner" xchain Token Projects until 2024?....

| 17ART | https://17art.io/ | 2022-03-30


17ART is a project that invites artists to submit works that focus on 'three different themes: Critical Art, Graphite Draw and Artistic Paint'. The token that is used to submit artistic pieces is called the CriticArt token and was distributed initially to the holders of three Rare Pepe tokens including: GAMESOFTRUMP, PEPEHEFNER and WORLDOFPEPE. The submissions mainly focus on politics, pepe, bitcoin culture, religion, gematria and physical art. The website also offers an optional project specific orange border to format artist submissions.


| Assetic | https://assetic.io/ | https://web.archive.org/web/20230604171359/https://assetic.io/ - 2023-06-03

This project, started by Indelible, focused on 'The Arweave Secured Standard' and invited artists to submit artwork by using the Arweave blockchain and a Counterparty description to publish their art. It was started as somewhat of a response to the expensive nature of minting Stamps using Counterparty at the time and set an example for using Arweave to maintain an 'on-chain' data reference while also including high resolution images.  The rules simply stated 'supply an ASS tag as your asset description and send asset ownership to a burn address'. A sample description would include ASS:'The Arweave Hash link to the artwork'|Assetic Art #69:ASS. The burn address is also a 'vanity' burn address and is as follows: 1AsseticXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXY69xbC. The artwork in this directory mainly focused on the aesthetic and beauty of the buttocks. Many of the submissions also include very high resolution images, gifs and videos. At this time the website is only accessible with the Wayback Machine and submissions do not seem to be open anymore.


| Barnyard Club | https://barnyard.club/ | 2022-07-10

Barnyard Club, created by Carsonated, is an extension and side-project of submissions after the Bitcorn project ended. The art included was released according to real world moon cycles and usually includes references to corn, farming, farm animals, pepe, cryptocurrency culture and graphic art. The directory includes art from many Counterparty artists and the submission token, CORNFUTURES, was dropped to all BITCORN holders in 2022. Submissions are still open at the time of writing.



| Bitcoin War Bonds | https://bitcoinwarbonds.law/ | April 5, 2022

Bitcoin War Bonds are a series of tokens that represent art and paintings by Tommy Marcheschi. He mentions on the project website 'THERE IS NO ROADMAP OTHER THAN MAKING ART AND PROPAGANDA... THIS IS A BITCOIN ART COLLECTION, NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS.' At this time the project features 13 pieces from 2022-2024 in a varying form of physical pieces including paintings, stickers, signed prints, a skateboard graphic and framed pieces. Most of the art is centered around war inspired propaganda to influence individuals to 'End Fiat' and influence the holding of Bitcoin. These pieces are backed by Counterparty tokens with Arweave descriptions to link to the digital art, but looks like in the future Bitcoin War Bonds will be migrating to Ordinals.



| Common Coco | https://commoncoco.wtf/ | 2023-08-14

Common Coco is a project directory started by Subterranean which includes Rejected Rare Coco submissions, Kaleidoscope Cocos and Cocos from other blockchains other than Counterparty. While the original Rare Coco directory (created by Kero) invites artists to create art in the form of Coco the crocodile (which is related and somewhat derived from Pepe the frog), this 'reject' directory is similar to the Series 0 of Fake Rares and Phunchkins in that this directory includes rejected cards from another project. To submit to this directory, an artist must submit their art, have it approved and then burn the COMNCOCOCASH token used for submissions.



| Crystal Collection | https://crystalsuite.com/crystal_collection | 2021-4-30

Crystal Collection is a series of seven different artworks by Albino-Z, Alejandro Hurtado and Herckeim minted on Counterparty, Ethereum and Klaytn. The early artwork is focused on historical projects in blockchain history like GEMZ, Sarutobi, Doge, the genesis bitcoin block and later blockchain history like Mt. Gox and the infamous DAO hack. Most of these artworks have extremely rare issuances, with The Doge at the highest of 15 separate 'prints'. The only one on Counterparty is the artwork commemorating Sarutobi and has 2 prints total, one of which was gifted to the developer, Christian Moss (MandelDuck).



| Drooling Ape Bus Club | https://droolingapebus.club | 2021-11-29 (tweet - https://x.com/AryanJabbari/status/1462075772982771712) Jason - https://x.com/GoingParabolic/status/1462087968542363658 - include JPG of original tweet | https://www.loom.com/share/1d5091b75e444219b9da57cdce813180


The Drooling Ape Bus Club is a series of open-submission art pieces that make fun of the well known Ethereum project 'Bored Ape Yacht Club'. The project was started by Brad Mills somewhat by a single idea in a tweet posted November 20, 2021. Brad was upset and annoyed from all of the celebrity interest and fake popularity spike of the Bored Apes, calling them 'sham jpgs' and invited any artist to create memes to make fun of them. He offered to pay 10 million satoshis per art piece. Brad explains he was angry that people like Jason A. Williams, who is a very Bitcoin centered voice in the community, hopped on board to the Bored Apes hype. Eventually Jason also tweeted something similar to Brad and influenced a very large twitter audience that he would give 10 million satoshis per art piece as well. This twitter interest and satoshi incentive not only inspired many indiviudals to create 'Drooling Apes', but would be eventually include influence by Aryan Jabbari to create a Telegram group to record all the art and start a community. Aryan Jabbari also began the work to start Counterparty collection/website and MikeInSpace would also be involved as a curator of the project. Later in time, Joe Looney and Bryan would be accepted on as curators for DABC. This happened in a very quick fashion after the twitter hype, to which Brad was frustrated and said "these are not NFT's, they are JPGs". He originally thought it was hypocritical to start an NFT project with art making fun of an NFT project, but the artists and admins eventually kicked Brad out because he was against the idea of minting these pieces or even calling them NFTs. The project is currently up to series 6 and is still accepting submissions at this time, though few spots remain. The submission rules require the art to be square, a non-divisible asset with at least 69 tokens issued and mentions 'the drawing should be original, not just a copy of a Bored Ape'. Most submissions, many by existing Counterparty artists, mock Bored Apes using grotesque, raunchy or ridiculous meme trolling and generally reference Counterparty culture as well. Some submissions use GIF's and are not limited to just square images as is in the Bored Ape collection. Many of the tokens also simply include an 'imgur' image link in the description, something that was common with submissions in the Rare Pepe Collection during 2016.



| Fake Ape Club | https://fakeapeclub.com | 2022-01-26

The Fake Ape Club is a series of open-submission art pieces that make fun of the well known Ethereum project 'Bored Ape Yacht Club'. This collection was started by Doge-Style and Silk and also includes many well known Counterparty artists. As with the Drooling Ape Bus Club, it was common for pieces to mock Bored Apes using gortesque, raunchy or ridiculous meme trolling and generally reference Counterparty culture as well. The Fake Ape Club also mentions 'We were aping around on Bitcoin long before Ordinal’s, there is actually a rich history of digital art assets (NFT’s) on Bitcoin, in contrast to modern believers that ordinals are the first NFTs on bitcoin.' The Fake Apes collection is up to series 7, still accepts submissions at this time and seems to be accepting submissions for a new sub-collection based on the asset 'FAKEMEMEZ'.



| Fake Commons | https://fakeraredirectory.com/fake-commons/ | 2022-04-18?

The Fake Commons Directory is a sub-collection of the Fake Rare Directory that involves destroying PEPECASH (a card/currency from Rare Pepe) to submit artwork. In a quick manner, the token used for Fake Rare submissions, FAKEASF, became very coveted and rapidly expensive for artists to submit to the directory. Since PEPECASH was burned by the artist for accepted submissions in the historical Rare Pepe project, the expansion into Fake Commons adopted this method. This opened up many new artworks from existing Counterparty artists and openly invited all artists to submit because the process was much cheaper and had much less strict curation from the Fake Rare 'scientists'. At this time there are over 51 separate series of Fake Commons with wildly ranging themes, references to pepe the frog, political and cryptocurrency history, popular meme culture, and many hidden artistic gems. Series 8, also called the Fake Commons Gallery Edition, stands out historically because the pieces included either had accompanying physical artwork shown in NYC during a 2022 event, or were given away to attendees using an in person Pepe themed ATM machine. Some series in the collection have themes such as KEKMAS and Pepertoy (series 47 and 48). Others have connections to in-person events such as Pepes in Paris (Series 44) and Bali Edition (Series 51). While Fake Rares have already reached a significant milestone in time, the Fake Commons collection has surpassed the time span in which this sub-collection will have been openly accepting submissions for longer than the original Rare Pepe project did. Submissions are still open at the time of this writing.


| Fake Munchkin | https://web.archive.org/web/20231030180309/https://www.fakemunchkin.com/ | https://munchkin.game/ | https://tokenscan.io/asset/FAKETREASURE | 2021-12-27

Fake Munchkin is a directory that invited artists to create custom art for trading cards in relation to a popular tabletop trading card game by Steve Jackson called 'Munchkin'. The submission process involved creating a Counterparty token and corresponding art that used templates for five different types of cards in the game: RACE, CLASS, CURSE, MONSTER or an ITEM card. At this time a total of 24 cards are accepted into the directory, with the community card FAKETREASURE, being the first in the series. Much of the accepted submissions incorporate the Fake Rare style of pepe art  with the intention of being actively used in a Series 1 mini-game sometime in the future. Many of the rejected cards from this collection would eventually be their own series in the Phunchkins project and many of the artists in both were active in the Fake Rare/Counterparty community at the time. It is unclear whether submissions are still open or if the Series 1 mini-game ever came into fruition.


| FAUX SOGS | https://fauxsogs.wtf | 2022-07-17

Faux Sogs is an open invitation card directory created by Coinking for creating fake 'or faux' Spells of Genesis art. Artists are invited to continue on the legacy, memetics, art style and history of SOG by using the trading card style template and fantasy inspired characters from Spells of Genesis. For example, the first card in the collection, IRLFDCARD, is directly inspired by the FDCARD token. The structure of the series has an interesting 'chase card' mechanism where the idea is to collect at least 11 or more other cards in the current series of 20 to have the privilege to create the final and 21st card in the series. The process of creating the chase card through community contributions only happened for the first series (FAUXDINGCARD), the rest of the series use the chase card process. This final chase card tends to be rarer, not only by design but also with issuance (as the normal minimum for issuance is 50 total tokens per card). Sometimes the chase card is earned by artists who had a stand out card in the series and personally collected the most from the other artists in that same series. Other times it is a collector who has collected at least 11/20 of the series submission. In this case the collector works with the curators to commission a chase card artwork. Herckeim, the artist of the original Spells of Genesis token SATOSHICARD, was also comissioned to design an art piece to comemmorate Series 1 of Faux Sogs which is a subasset of the FAUXSOGS token (FAUXSOGS.21.SERIES1) which is not apart of the collection itself. There are currently 13 total series of 21 separate Faux Sogs tokens per series by many well-known Counterparty artists. Submissions are still open at this time.


| FootballCoin | https://www.footballcoin.io | 2017-01-21 __ 2017-05-16 | https://cdn.footballcoin.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/WhitePaper_FootballCoin.pdf | https://www.footballcoin.io/everything-you-need-to-know-before-entering-the-footballcoin-game/

This innovative project, FootballCoin, originally looked to use Counterparty Tokens to give a user the chance to building a fantasy soccer team. This process included choosing real world professional players from the different leagues listed in the game, choosing formation types, relying on their real world performance to gain points, and picking players specifically backed by digital tokens in the fantasy game. Originally in 2017 the coin XFCCOIN was minted to serve as the intermediary exchange token between the subsequent 469 separate soccer players (represented with individual tokens) that users could choose to add to their team. Many of the tokens varied in issuance between 1500-5000 total token units and the XFCCOIN could be exchanged into XCP and eventually directly into Bitcoin. As described in the FootballCoin whitepaper, 'in 2018 we launched our very own blockchain' and rewarded existing holders with a '3:1 conversion of XFCCOIN from Counterparty to the new blockchain'. Since then, many new players and tokens have been created on the new XFCCOIN platform, but the originial Counterparty tokens still show as the building blocks and genesis of FootballCoin. The FootballCoin fantasy football game is still live at the time of this writing and their website includes in depth tutorials on their website on how to navigate the fanstasy FootballCoin user interface.

| Modern Relics | https://modernrelics.io | 2023-04-02 - https://tokenscan.io/asset/COLLECTOR - https://dogeparty.tokenscan.io/asset/COLLECTOR

Modern Relics is a collection of historic tokens minted Dogeparty in 2014 and Counterparty in 2015 created by Ernest and Jdog. Since both of those protocols do not allow multiple token names with the same characters, many of the early tokens were simply people reserving common names for resell value in the future. Modern Relics strove to bring new life to those early mints that commonly had little or no extra information attached to them. On their website they state, 'this project aims to breathe new life into this collection of ancient tokens by making them more appealing and tradeable, with desirable characteristics'. The distribution process for this project revolves around the COLLECTOR token (two separate tokens, one on Dogeparty and one on Counterparty). If a collector holds COLLECTOR they automatically recieve one airdrop of a monthly modern relic. These relics are early minted names like 'GREED' or 'CRAB' but Modern Relics provides a way for artists to submit art that will be added to the descriptions of these old tokens. The distribution schedule of the drops, which started in May of 2023 and continues to this day, is shown on the Modern Relics website. If an artist submission wins, they recieve 25 out of the 100 supply of these old token relics, the rest are distributed to COLLECTOR holders. According to the website, even rejected submissions will 'have the artwork minted as a custom sub-asset [of the relic token]. The artist will [also] be given full ownership of their sub-asset with the ability to issue supply, lock, etc.' The artwork submission fee for Modern Relics and their 
'sister project' Rude Relics is a token named RELICSUBMIT that has a current supply of about 997 tokens. During the initial months of this project much of the trading and exchanging of relics used the RELICASH coin in a similar manner to the way Rare Pepe used PEPECASH to exchange value. This included trading cards that were outside of this collection for RELICASH, with the hope to acquire rarer relics.


| Rude Relics | https://ruderelics.io | 2023-04-02 - https://tokenscan.io/asset/HARDCORE - https://dogeparty.tokenscan.io/asset/HARDCORE


Rude Relics ia collection of historic tokens minted Dogeparty in 2014 and Counterparty in 2015 created by Ernest and Jdog. Since both of those protocols do not allow multiple token names with the same characters, many of the early tokens were simply people reserving common names for resell value in the future. Rude Relics, unlike Modern Relics, is focused on mainly raunchy and 'completely inappropriate' tokens from those years. The distribution process for this project revolves around the HARDCORE token (two separate tokens, one on Dogeparty and one on Counterparty). If a collector holds HARDCORE they automatically recieve one airdrop of a monthly rude relic. These relics are early minted names like 'HERPES' or 'HEROIN' but Rude Relics provides a way for artists to submit art that will be added to the descriptions of these old tokens. The distribution schedule of the drops, which started in May of 2023 and continues to this day, is shown on the Rude Relics website. If an artist submission wins, they recieve 25 out of the 100 supply of these old token relics, the rest are distributed to COLLECTOR holders. According to the website, even rejected submissions will 'have the artwork minted as a custom sub-asset [of the relic token]. The artist will [also] be given full ownership of their sub-asset with the ability to issue supply, lock, etc.' The artwork submission fee for Rude Relics and their 
'sister project' Modern Relics is a token named RELICSUBMIT that has a current supply of about 997 tokens. During the initial months of this project much of the trading and exchanging of relics used the RELICASH coin in a similar manner to the way Rare Pepe used PEPECASH to exchange value. This included trading cards that were outside of this collection for RELICASH, with the hope to acquire rarer relics.


| Rare Bobo | https://rarebobo.com/ | 2022-04-27

Rare Bobo is a Counterparty collection dedicated to memes of 'Bobo the Bear' created by Boost. The use of this meme generally came out of the bear market of cryptocurrency from 2022-2023 and most of these tokens originated in the Dank Rare Directory first before being organized into the Rare Bobo directory. Much of the tokens in the directory include digital art but also include gifs, stamps and video. The tokens are reminiscent of the art from Rare Pepe and the Dank Rare Directory, but includes the Bobo meme instead of Pepe. 

| Rare Coco | https://rarecoco.wtf/ | 2023-07-19

Rare Coco is a collection of token artwork that centers around the 'Coco' crocodile meme created by Kero. The collection involved many existing Counterparty and Rare Pepe artists in which they were required to burn a token named COBBEE to submit artwork for review. While the submissions closed at the date of the 2024 Bitcoin halving, five series of cards were accepted totalling 213 cards.

| Rare GoGo | https://raregogo.wtf | 2024-02-17

Rare GoGo is a collection of token artwork created by Darky that originally invited the 'Greatest Of All Time' Counterparty artists. The art centered around the subject of a goat, but many pieces readily reference Counterparty culture, cryptocurrency culture and art history. Submissions are now open to the public at this time. The rules have a strict requirement of 21 tokens and also requires artists to destroy a FAKEGREENS token, which is a Fake Commons card by Darky. 

| Rare Lands | https://rarelands.wtf | https://web.archive.org/web/20240414002639/https://rarelands.wtf/ - 2022-05-05

Rare Lands is an open-submission project started by DarkFarms. Much of the art involves plots of land and pepe related memetics. While the submissions seemed to remain open, the website is only accessible through the Wayback Machine. At this time, there is a total of 51 cards in series one and many well-known Counterparty artists were involved in making the art that was accepted.

| Rare Ordinal Directory | http://rareordinal.directory | 2023-01-29

The Rare Ordinal Directory is a forward thinking way to solidify token data using the Ordinal protocol. This directory was created by Bench, Goat and Dan Anderson. The collection invites users to mint their art using Ordinal inscriptions then include that data in the description of the Counterparty asset. This extends Counterparty functionality to not only the data of the token to be inscribed in a more robust manner, but also extends the functionality of an Ordinal Inscription by creating a bigger issuance of the token and art itself. On their website the project states the purpose is to 'represent the next logical mechanism for artists to create and share their work. Using a combination of immutable, cryptographically unbreakable protocols, artists now have the ability to preserve their work eternally on the Bitcoin blockchain.' What is interesting about this project is that the Counterparty token created in this project must be a divisible token with a supply of 1, which turns the 1/1 non-divisible. This project, like Rare Pepe and Fake Commons, requires the PEPECASH token to be burned to be accepted into this collection. Submissions are still open and there is a total of 5 series of Rare Ordinals live at this time.

| Rare Shadilay | https://rareshadilay.com | 2022-07-19

Rare Shadilay is a collection created by MikeInSpace that includes user created art submissions based around the legendary album art and song called 'Shadilay' by the Italian disco band 'P.E.P.E.' released in 1986. Much of the accepted submissions either reference the Shadilay art style, Rare Pepe history and light-hearted or fun expression of the Shadilay pepe character. Though, keep in mind it is very clear on their website that this collection is 'Not Rare Pepe. This is Rare Shadilay, baby!'. Much of the submissions involve many current and historical Counterparty artists. At this time, submissions for this project are unlikely to open again in the future and the collection ended with 3 series totalling 150 cards total.

| RareSocks | https://raresocks.xyz | 2023-01-30

Rare Socks is an open-invitation art directory created by 'The Sock Master' that includes Counterparty assets related to 'socks'. This term, which is a Telegram slang term for people creating new accounts and posing as different users, makes fun of any users or scammers lurking under different names in the Counterparty community. As stated on the website, 'many Rare Socks are a twist on some classic Rare/Dank/Fake Pepe's' but 'with an original sockystyle twist'. To submit to the directory, which is currently on series 5 at this time, a user must have their submission accepted and burn a token called SOCKSCAMCASH. This directory hopes to bring 'awareness that some Telegram users are willing to go to any extreme and create hundreds of sock accounts for bad intentions'. Submissions are still open at this time.


| RetroXCP | https://retro-xcp.art/ | 2022-01-10

RetroXCP, originally called 'Retroid', is an open-invitation Counterparty collection that was created by Aryan J, Sam Kimbrow, and Whoisit. The collection invites users to mix pre-2000 video game culture with Counterparty asset art. At the moment there are 2 series of 92 separate accepted pieces, the first of which was focused on games and the second based on movies. Much of the art is by well known Counterparty artists and adds a 'retro flavor to Counterparty mascots/memes' while involving some of the most legendary and respected video game culture icons from the 80's and 90's. Compared to other Counterparty collections and directories, RetroXCP does not require the burning of any other assets for a user's submission to be accepted into the directory. Submissions are still open and at this time and users are invited to submit anything pre-Y2K related for the current series. 


| Scannable NFTs | https://scannablenfts.com/ | 2022-01-05

This Counterparty project is an open-invitation token collection created by mightbemike that involves art that can be scannable as a QR code. The requirements of the submissions is that all pieces in the collection 'must be scannable using a phone camera'. While there is 'no limit to the number of QR codes you can use' in the artwork, there is strict guidelines for image dimensions and size. There are also strict guidelines for what the QR code can link the user to, such as not using link shortener services nor forwarding to NSFW content. There are also different collection genres a user can form their art towards such as famous artists, charity, music, geography and others. Some of the collections have been locked and cannot be submitted to and others are still open for submissions at this time. Each closed and 'locked' collection involves anywhere from 8-18 pieces and composing of many existing Counterparty artists and wildly creative ways to creatively show a QR code. Many of the pieces go to great artistic length to reference worldwide art history, memetic culture, Counterparty culture, and highly intricate uses of moving images (gifs) while still being scannable by a standard phone camera.

| Spamgelo | https://spamgelo.io | 2022-03-08

This project, started by Spamgelo, is an open-invitation art collection that has a great emphasis of phalic symbols. Many of the artworks include references to art history, political history, memetics and Counterparty culture using highly NSFW and raunchy imagery. The collection boasts a total of 70 separate art pieces (or as the website expresses: 69.69 pieces) designed from many different Counterparty artists. The amount of issuance for each card varies anywhere from 69-420 total tokens per card, though DICKPEPE, is as scarce as 33 total tokens and the last card in the series at this time, MCPICKLE, is 1337 total token issuance. The 'Genesis Series' is still open for submissions at this time, though you will have to make sure your art is approved by 'Spamgelo and The Disciples' before your submission can be approved and minted.

| The Pepe Project | http://pepeproject.com/ | 2022-01-23

The Pepe Project is a series open-invitation collection started by GMONEY. This collection includes highly political artwork attached to Counterparty tokens. As stated on the website these tokens help 'explore the mysterious rabbit hole' with artwork 'based on research that connect TRUMP - BITCOIN - PEPE - Q'. The first card in Series 1 is called FIRSTMARKER and links a Q post mentioning 'TEST' to the first user created asset on Counterparty named 'TEST'. Much of the art references 'Q posts', well known Trump tweets like 'covfefe', popular political culture, past Counterparty culture and also religious themes including an emphasis on gematria. At this time there are 8 different series of submissions with varying themes for each series. After starting this collection GMONEY invited a significant amount of listeners of the Rugpull Radio show he hosts, the existing Counterparty community as well as followers of the 'bullion, bitcoin & bitties w/GMONEY' groups to create art for the collection. At this time 'Series X' is still open for users to submit artwork to. The submission process is done by sending GMONEY an email shown on the website or contacting GMONEY via Telegram (@pappyG45) with the art and token information.


| The Wojak Way | https://thewojakway.com/ | 2018-06-10

The Wojak Way is an open-invitation art collection created by Abstrast Mirror that centers around the well known 'Wojak' meme character. The project states on their website they hope to see 'creative interpretations of Wojak in the form of memes, fine art, political satire, video GIFs and more'. This project aims to be 'an organic NFT collection' and that 'curation is essential'. At this time there are 6 total series with a total of 260 separate art pieces from very well-known artists, many of which from the Counterparty community. Some of the art simply includes the Wojak character similar to how it is expressed in common internet memes, but other pieces are incredible artistic endeavors with intricate content and form. Many of the pieces and artists also came together for an in-person gallery event in London during 2023. At this time submissions for this project are still open, but not many spots in the collection remain.

- Early AI Art - (2016-10-19)

While the line between programmed, generative or 'Artificial Intelligence' art is somewhat blurred and hard to distiguish in artistic pieces, it is known that very early AI pieces were published using Counterparty tokens. Since Rare Pepe was a project that invited any artist from around the world to participate, many new styles of artworks appeared in 2016-2017 and this is where much of the early AI art emerges. The oldest AI artwork on Counterparty (that we know of) is a Rare Pepe token by Mr. BitcoinBeast called PEPEME which used a website AI tool called 'deepart io'. Despite PEPEME having the oldest minting date, other pieces like PEPEALIEN by CryptoChainer, SCORPEPE, KEKSBASILISK by Katie Charm, NEUROPEPE by Alex Green, KEKTOPUS by Meme Conscious, CUBISTPEPE by Looks Rare, NAHUAL by Duncan and quite a few others have been found to use AI or AI programs. These include Deep Dream, Prism, Piscart AI or a mix between a few separate programs. This topic seems very contemporary and many questions and debates have arisen over which programs were used to create the art, what type of programming style or AI type was used in that tool, whether or not the art was copied from an earlier artist and what even constitutes as an AI tool at all. It comes as no suprise individuals now and into the future will wonder about the crossover into AI art becoming commonplace and it is evident Counterparty tokens were apart of that crossover period, but it is still unclear regarding 'which was first'.

- Monegraph Mints from Namecoin to XCP - https://nmc.vision/?trait=monegraph - October 9, 2014 (MGAAAAAAAAAAA) and March 3, 2015 (A1028163271339900500)

Within a prior protocol called Namecoin, Monegraphs (Monetized Graphics) were among the first blockchain collectibles with artwork and the intention of digital ownership. These assets became very popular when Sotheby's auctioned off 'Quantum' for $1.4 million dollars, the first piece in Monegraphs by Kevin McCoy. While eighteen of these tokens were created using Namecoin, two of them by Joe Hamilton were minted using Counterparty. The first of which is a named asset called MGAAAAAAAAAAA that included a Vimeo file link, a sha256 hash, a Twitter link, ownership of the artwork and a JSON as the description. The video file included with this asset is an avante-garde video piece titled 'Regular Division'. While MGAAAAAAAAAAA is a non-divisible asset with a current supply of 1, the token issuance is not locked at this time. The second asset, A1028163271339900500, is a numeric divisible asset minted in March of 2015 that also has remained unlocked for issuance at the time of this writing. This token included much less information as MGAAAAAAAAAAA and simply includes a JSON in the description.

- Longest Asset Name - 2018-11-21 

The addition of 'subassets' to named Counterparty assets opened up the possibility of many new features regarding the extension of functionality of named assets. Some of which would be used not only in historical assets like DJPEPE but also in new projects like NPCS. This specific asset is a subasset to the named token KALEIDOSCOPE, which is the genesis project token for the Kaleidoscope project. The minter of this NFT, Nathan, did not include any extra information in the description. He decided to make the token non-divisible and went on to lock the token supply at one token. It was the first subasset to use the max amount of characters avaliable to that Counterparty token type. The asset is simply named: 'KALEIDOSCOPE.The_worlds_first_ever_longest_digital_asset_name_and_an_experiment_of_an_experiment_on_the_blockchain_verified_forever_by_the_counterparty_protocol_and_bitcoin_OPreturn'.

- 2021-06-11 – THING – first parent asset (after BITCORN.GLASSES) to be destroyed to a 1/1


- 2021-06-11 - THING – NFT by Destroy

As with BITCORN.GLASSES, in general the Counterparty community generally destroyed token supply by sending tokens to a burn address. After the Destroy Function was enabled in 2018, it would not be until THING was destroyed by Joe Looney down to a single non-divisible token unit that a named asset was destroyed into an 'NFT'. It was not uncommon for artists in previous projects like Rare Pepe to reduce circulating supply by sending to burn counterparty addresses, but THING was the first named asset to specifically use the destroy function to create an NFT after destroy was enabled on the protocol. Joe included a memo in the burn transaction on June 11 of 2021 which stated 'there can only be one'.
