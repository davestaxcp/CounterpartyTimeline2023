This repo is dedicated to publicly organizing and critiquing a public list for Counterparty’s vast historical tokens, projects and developer updates to the Counterparty Protocol since Counterparty’s inception.

## Goal

---

The goal for this data is to eventually include it all into a cool infographic style Historical Timeline to be published on [Counterparty.io](https://counterparty.io/) in a new page titled “History”. 

This timeline idea was originally published in [this Counterparty Forum post](https://forums.counterparty.io/t/updating-information-on-counterparty-io/6669/8) which was about updating the Counterparty website to include more current information. It was then moved to these two posts: [here](https://forums.counterparty.io/t/counterparty-developer-timeline-for-counterparty-io/6675) and [here](https://forums.counterparty.io/t/counterparty-token-asset-project-timeline-for-counterparty-io/6688), but now finally lives here in this repo.

It is my hope that this data below will give more inspirational education to the current and future Counterparty community, as well as give light on historical and groundbreaking projects done in the past using the Counterparty protocol.

## Notes From the Author

---

This is still a public draft.

The process of gathering blockchain information, organizing the data correctly and getting critiques is still underway.

Some assets post-2021 have been included, but since so many projects and notable assets have been made since 2021, a significant amount of the recent Counterparty projects have been omitted to focus on the previous historical developments of the older tokens. 

Some developer updates that are still underway (or pre-drafted) are yet to be included until they are officially in the [Counterparty CIP list](https://github.com/jdogresorg/cips).

I invite you to verify, critique and pull request this information to perfect this list so all can benefit off of the goal of publishing this content on [Counterparty.io](Counterparty.io) and for any educational purposes beyond that.

Feel free to reach out to me on [Telegram](https://t.me/davesta) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davesta_xcp) if you need to request changes to information or would like to contribute to the data included here.
