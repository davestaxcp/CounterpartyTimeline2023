This idea aims to use less space than the 'stamps' (CIP25 and CIP26) method while also encoding the data of the file directly onchain to represent an issuance or broadcast. JP noted in CIP33, 'With Stamps the Bitcoin transaction is three times larger than the file, and for each byte of the file 26 satoshis are burnt. With CIP33 the tx is just 50% larger than the file, and only 11 sats are burnt per byte. This makes CIP33 more than 50% cheaper than Stamps.'
