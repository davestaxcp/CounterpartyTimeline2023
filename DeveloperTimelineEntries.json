        "Event": "Eliminate Fee on Subasset Registration",
        "Significance": "This protocol change looks to eliminate the XCP fee associated with creating a subasset. Since many of early arguments for having an XCP on named asset creation was centered on an 'anti-squatting' mechanism, the community argues that this is not needed for subasset registrations since the creator already owns the main named asset used. This update also pairs well with the introduction of subasset creation with numeric tokens as well as the Glyphs proposal by MikeInSpace.",

        "Event": "Subassets on Numerics",
        "Significance": "This proposal invites the Counterparty protocol to introduce subassets on numeric tokens. While this is already possible with named assets and is somewhat of a simple upgrade, this proposal also includes documentation for using this new functionality for 'Glyphs'. Issuing subassets on Numerics, MikeInSpace proposes, incorporates a new token 'meta-protocol' that can introduce a 'runes-like' functionality with subassets on numerics. This means these numeric subassets 'can be leveraged to create a Runes-like, but better, tokenization standard'. This proposal brings together the Fair Mint proposal, Elimination of Fees on Subassets and this much simpler Subassets on Numerics porposal to introduce an new contemporary token standard using Counterparty.",

Also, as mentioned on the Counterpary website 'When you use Counterwallet, all transactions are signed on your device and your private keys are never stored on our servers. All information sent to our servers is encrypted by your Counterwallet client for maximum security, and every trace of your session is erased when you log out. All you need is your passphrase for easy and secure access.' This wallet was working and live up until January 14, 2024 when the servers hosting this wallet were taken down due to an issue with a new protocol update. While a few types of fixes were proposed at the time, the current lead developer (Adam Krellenstein) has stated that he will not be working to bring this wallet back online, nor update it to the more recent features offered with the Counterparty protocol. Instead Adam and his developing team are focusing on a new wallet called 'Horizon' under their UnspendableLabs platform.",

This wallet application referred to assets/tokens/cards on Counterparty as 'Orbs' and many users in the community mention the Book of Orbs interface as their favorite user interface designs overall to trade Counterparty assets. Sadly this wallet was discontinued and the EverdreamSoft team mentioned in a Medium article that 'its dependencies on third-part services made it very difficult to maintain the application up to date and working correctly.'

The original purpose for developing Freewallet, as mentioned in his ZeroG interview, was to create a wallet he could use personally to do Counterparty actions that are accepted by the protocol, but were not offered by Counterwallet for regular users at that time. This wallet is now the most up-to-date and most commonly used wallet in the Counterparty community due to the Freewallet Desktop version offering all Counterparty functionality allowed on the protocol such as: client-side authentication and encryption, sending and receiving Bitcoin/XCP and all Counterparty assets, creating and managing tokens and token ownership, distributing dividends, broadcasting data using Counterparty broadcasts, signing messages and transactions, using the Counterparty Decentralized exchange for all asset types, an integrated exchange interface for the Counterparty DEx and Dispensers (including dispenser watchlists), multiple addresses support (including Segwit addresses), add-on password functionality, QR codes for public addresses, Counterwallet and BIP-39 seed types, reset token divisibility status, support of the BTCpay mechanisms for trading against BTC pairs on Counterparty, the Multi-send functionality and much more. Freewallet Mobile version is avaliable on the App Store (for Mac) and Google Play Store (for Android) and many users start with the mobile wallet, but this mobile version has not been updated since March 15, 2019 and does not include a vast majority of Counterparty features. So it is recommended to use the standalone Desktop version as it is updated and maintained more regularly. The Freewallet.io website also includes a community created User Manual (written by davesta) and a community supported Telegram chat for users to ask questions regarding Freewallet functionality. Since the underlying code was and has always been public, new developers such as Noop have used the base functionality/code of Freewallet to develop NinjaWallet later in time. It is also highly recommended to verify that you as a user are downloading the correct wallet from Freewallet.io as other wallets (that do not support Counterparty) have a similar name but are not at all connected to this Counterparty specific wallet.",

Originally this was hosted on 'RarePepeWallet.com', but was later moved to the URL: 'RarePepeWallet.wtf'. The new version of this wallet also supports ease of use on a mobile device, minting tokens within the wallet using the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), and even was used in the Fest Rares collection to give users an in-person free mint pass to create custom pepe art. Traders using this wallet can use simple Bitcoin functionality, card for card trading using the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange, as well as buying and selling assets using PEPECASH/XCP (which was the most common way to trade Rare Pepe's in 2016-2019). This wallet is also very known for labeling all 'non-RarePepe' assets as 'Fake Rares' as was a cultural custom in the Rare Pepe community, though access to all types of Counterparty tokens owned is supported within the user interface. This wallet also historically had a 'gift-card' feature to easily gift new users a card by redeeming a one-time-use code. These codes were also commonly hidden within Rare Pepe submission art as well as image metadata.",

This open-source wallet was built atop of the bitcoin blockchain and offered smartphone users the ability to send and receive Bitcoin/Tokens and use the Counterparty decentralized exchange with client-side encryption. This wallet also offered the ability to issue their own tokens and display fiat values in a users' local currency. The wallet was built with mainstream conveniences in mind, such as push notifications, touch id authorization and even contemporary updates to Counterparty at the time like the sweep function. This wallet was also historically used in the Sarutobi game as well as the Takara project, but was discontinued in late 2019. While the company and its resources ran into hard times in 2018, this wallet was very significant to the Counterparty ecosystem and definitely historically notable.",

They created a project code-named Medici, which was a 'front-end and portal to the decentralized stock exchange of the Counterparty platform'. Since the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange had become popular at this time, this cryptographic layer aimed to re-create the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange while also going through a private process of regulatory compliance. In a Coindesk article Byrne said, '[Counterparty] is true to the ethics of bitcoin, true to the open-source nature, they're true to the principles.' While this venture was closed in April of 2021, Overstock stated in the press release, 'We remain bullish on blockchain technology and are excited for Medici Ventures to enter this new post-closing phase' and also go on to mention they would be shifting focus to their 'core e-commerce business'.",
